Task: Fix mcmodel=kernel addressing to distinguish value vs pointer uses of GlobalAddr
Status: completed

Problem:
  The initial mcmodel=kernel fix (commit 4b7d08d) changed ALL emit_global_addr calls
  to use absolute addressing (movq $symbol) when code_model_kernel is true. This gives
  correct link-time virtual addresses for expressions like (unsigned long)_text, but
  causes kernel early boot failures when global variables are read/written through
  pointers -- absolute addresses are virtual addresses that can't be dereferenced
  before page tables are set up.

Fix:
  Classify each GlobalAddr IR value as either:
  1. Address-as-value (not used as Load/Store pointer) -> absolute R_X86_64_32S
  2. Address-as-pointer (used as Load/Store pointer or GEP base) -> RIP-relative

  This is done via build_global_addr_ptr_set() pre-scan in generation.rs, which
  identifies GlobalAddr values that flow into Load/Store pointer operands (directly
  or through GEP chains).

Files changed:
  src/backend/generation.rs - build_global_addr_ptr_set + dispatch logic
  src/backend/traits.rs - emit_global_addr_absolute trait method
  src/backend/x86/codegen/codegen.rs - emit_global_addr (RIP-rel) + emit_global_addr_absolute
  tests/mcmodel-kernel-global-addr-value-x86/ - regression test
