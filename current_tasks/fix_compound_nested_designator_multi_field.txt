Fix: compound struct init with multiple nested field designators targeting same outer field

Bug: When a struct global initializer has multiple items with nested field designators
that all target the same outer struct field (e.g., .mmu.f1 = fb, .mmu.f2 = fc, .mmu.f3 = fd),
only the first sub-field gets initialized. The rest are zero-filled.

Root cause: In emit_field_inits_compound(), when inits.len() > 1 and items have nested
field designators, the code falls through to emit_compound_flat_array_init instead of
collecting the items and delegating to sub-struct compound initialization.

Fix: Add a check in the multiple-inits branch for nested field designators targeting a
struct field. Collect sub-items with adjusted designators and emit as a sub-struct init.

Affects: kernel/power/suspend.c (via paravirt.c pv_ops struct), and likely many other
kernel files with similar patterns.
