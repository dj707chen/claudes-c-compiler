Fix ARM builtin assembler: BIC instruction routing and bitmask immediate encoding

Two bugs fixed:
1. BIC instruction was incorrectly routed to NEON-only encoder, causing failures
   for scalar BIC with registers and immediates. Now properly handles:
   - BIC Xd, Xn, Xm [, shift #amount] (scalar register form)
   - BIC Xd, Xn, #imm (scalar immediate form, encoded as AND Xd, Xn, #~imm)
   - BIC Vd.T, Vn.T, Vm.T (NEON vector form, existing)

2. encode_bitmask_imm had wrong rotation direction: it computed the rotation
   to go FROM actual value TO base pattern, but immr should be the rotation
   FROM base pattern TO actual value. Fixed by using (size - r) % size.

Also added:
- EON instruction support (exclusive OR NOT)
- Shift operand support for ORN, BICS (previously only supported simple register forms)
