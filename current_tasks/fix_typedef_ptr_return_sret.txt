Bug: Function pointers with typedef'd pointer return types incorrectly classified as struct returns (sret)

Root cause: extract_func_ptr_return_ctype in expr_types.rs unconditionally peeled one
CType::Pointer wrapper from function return types, assuming it was a syntax artifact from
build_full_ctype's declarator processing. However, when the return type is a typedef'd
pointer (e.g., typedef struct TableScanDescData *TableScanDesc), the Pointer IS the actual
return type. Peeling it exposed CType::Struct(...), triggering incorrect sret classification.

This caused all arguments to shift by one register position (hidden sret pointer inserted
as first arg in rdi), so callees received wrong values. In PostgreSQL, this manifested as
table_beginscan calling heap_beginscan through the TableAmRoutine vtable with corrupted
nkeys argument, causing "invalid memory alloc request size" (~47GB) fatal error during
bootstrap.

Fix: Rewrote extract_func_ptr_return_ctype to handle three CType shapes correctly:
1. Pointer(Function(return_type)) - return type used directly (no peeling)
2. Pointer(Pointer(Function(return_type))) - outer Pointer is return-type pointer,
   reconstruct as Pointer(return_type)
3. Pointer(X) where X is not Function - typedef lost Function node, X is return type

Files changed:
- src/ir/lowering/expr_types.rs (extract_func_ptr_return_ctype rewrite)
- tests/typedef-ptr-return-fptr-vtable/ (new regression test)

Status: LOCKED
