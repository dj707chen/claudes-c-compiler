Fix RISC-V switch case branch range overflow

The RISC-V backend used beq/bgeu (B-type, +-4KB range) instructions for
switch case dispatch and jump table range checks. In large functions like
PostgreSQL's ExecInterpExpr, case targets exceed the 4KB distance, causing
silent branch target overflow and incorrect execution.

Fix: Replace beq with bne+jump and bgeu with bltu+jump patterns, using the
jump pseudo-instruction which has +-2GB range via auipc+jalr.

This matches the pattern already used in emit_fused_cmp_branch.
