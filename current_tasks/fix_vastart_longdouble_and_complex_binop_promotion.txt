Task: Fix va_start long double handling and complex binary operation type promotion

Three bugs fixed:

1. x86-64 va_start: long double parameters incorrectly counted as FP register params
   File: src/backend/x86/codegen/codegen.rs
   - Long double is x87 class (stack-passed, 16 bytes), not XMM register-passed
   - overflow_arg_area now correctly skips past named long double parameters
   - Added num_named_stack_bytes field to track stack-passed named params

2. Complex expr_ctype missing VaArg/StmtExpr/AddressOf cases
   File: src/ir/lowering/complex.rs
   - VaArg expression had no match arm, fell through to CType::Int
   - This caused *va_arg(vl, float _Complex *) to produce garbage
   - Added proper cases for VaArg, StmtExpr, AddressOf, improved Conditional

3. Complex compound assignment type promotion with integer operands
   File: src/ir/lowering/complex.rs
   - common_complex_type(ComplexFloat, Int) returned ComplexDouble
   - This caused _Complex float x -= int_y to use 16-byte ops on 8-byte slot
   - Rewrote with rank-based comparison: integers don't force promotion to double

Status: Completed
