Fix x86 shared library linker: emit R_X86_64_64 dynamic relocations for named
global symbols in data sections (function pointer tables, vtables, dispatch tables).
Previously these were incorrectly emitted as R_X86_64_RELATIVE, causing NULL
function pointer crashes at runtime. Also fix .gnu.hash bloom filter scaling
for large symbol tables.
