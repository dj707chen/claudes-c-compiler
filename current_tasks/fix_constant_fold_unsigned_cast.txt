Task: Fix constant folding for unsigned type casts

Problem:
The fold_cast() function in passes/constant_fold.rs only handles signed source/target
types (I8, I16, I32) for truncation and sign-extension. Unsigned types (U8, U16, U32)
fall through to a pass-through case (_ => val) which neither truncates nor zero-extends.

This causes miscompilation when constant folding processes casts involving unsigned types:
  - (unsigned char)0x1FF should be 255 but folds to -1
  - Cast from U8 to I32 should zero-extend but sign-extends instead
  - (unsigned int)(-1L) should be 4294967295 but folds to -1

The bug only manifests at -O1 and above (when constant folding runs).

Fix:
1. Add U8, U16, U32 cases to fold_cast() source type matching (zero-extend)
2. Add U8, U16, U32 cases to fold_cast() target type matching (zero-extend/truncate)
3. Add regression test
4. Add tests to the Rust test module
