Task: Fix 2D/multi-dimensional global array initialization

Status: IN PROGRESS

Problem:
Two bugs in flatten_global_array_init() in global_init.rs cause multi-dimensional
global arrays to be initialized with wrong values:

1. Fencepost error: `while values.len() <= current_idx` should be `< current_idx`.
   The <= inserts a spurious zero before every element in the 1D base case.

2. Flat initialization (no inner braces) of multi-dim arrays incorrectly advances
   current_outer_idx per scalar instead of per filled sub-array. Each bare scalar
   was treated as filling an entire sub-array row.

Fix:
- Change `<=` to `<` on the padding condition in the 1D base case
- Track start_len and compute current_outer_idx from relative position for bare scalars
- Keep braced sub-list alignment at sub-array boundaries

Impact: Fixes ~9 test failures including right-shift, two-dimensional-array, and
multidimensional-array tagged tests.
