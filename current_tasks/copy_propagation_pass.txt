Copy Propagation IR Optimization Pass

Implementing a copy propagation pass to eliminate redundant Copy instructions in the IR.
This replaces uses of Copy destinations with the original source operand, collapsing
chains of copies and reducing stack traffic in the generated code.

Expected impact: significant runtime improvement for all backends since every Copy
currently becomes a load-from-stack -> accumulator -> store-to-stack sequence.
