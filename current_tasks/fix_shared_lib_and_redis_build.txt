Task: Fix -shared flag support and redis build

The redis build fails because:
1. xxhash's `make lib` target builds a shared library using -shared flag
2. Our compiler recognizes -shared but silently ignores it (TODO in main.rs:146)
3. The shared library build fails, preventing libxxhash.a from being created
4. redis-server link step fails with "cannot find ../deps/xxhash/libxxhash.a"

Fix: Implement -shared flag to pass through to gcc linker, and ensure
the compiler properly handles shared library creation mode.
Also investigate and fix postgres configure failure.
