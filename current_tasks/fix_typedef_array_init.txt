Fix typedef array initialization (flat initializer bug)

When a variable is declared with a typedef'd array type like:
  typedef struct { int a; int b; } S;
  typedef S arr_t[4];
  static arr_t x = { 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 };

The flat initializer incorrectly treats each struct element as a scalar,
assigning only 1 value per struct. Result: x[0]={1,0} instead of {1,2}.

The non-typedef equivalent works correctly:
  static S x[4] = { 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 };  // x[0]={1,2} - correct

Fix is in the initialization/global_init code that resolves the type during
aggregate initialization. The typedef needs to be resolved to its underlying
array type before walking the initializer elements.

Affects ~10-15 tests across all architectures (compiler_suite_0053_*, 0011_*, etc).
