Task: Fix AArch64 'K' inline asm constraint to validate logical immediates
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-27

Problem: The 'K' constraint on AArch64 means "logical immediate" (value encodable
in the N:immr:imms bitmask field of AND/ORR/EOR/TST instructions). However, our
compiler uses x86 semantics (0-255) for 'K', causing invalid values like 0 to be
emitted as immediates. The assembler then rejects instructions like "eor w9, w10, 0"
because 0 is not a valid AArch64 logical immediate.

This breaks compilation of kernel files that use cmpxchg (fs/locks.c, mm/memcontrol.c,
net/core/filter.c, etc.) where the "old" value is 0.

Fix: Override constant_fits_immediate() in the ARM InlineAsmEmitter to properly
validate AArch64 logical immediates using the N:immr:imms encoding algorithm.
Also add 'I' constraint support (0-4095 for add/sub immediates).
