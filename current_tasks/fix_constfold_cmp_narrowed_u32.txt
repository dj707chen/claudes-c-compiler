Fix constant folding of comparisons after narrow pass truncates U32 constants

Bug: When the narrow pass narrowed a Cmp from I64 to U32, constants like
4294967295 (0xFFFFFFFF) were stored as IrConst::I32(-1). The constant fold
pass later read this via to_i64() which sign-extends to 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF,
causing Eq comparisons with the original 0x00000000FFFFFFFF value to fail.

Fix in two places:
1. constant_fold.rs: Add truncate_to_type() to normalize Cmp operands to
   the comparison type's width before folding, ensuring bit-level equality
   is correct regardless of IrConst storage representation.
2. narrow.rs: Use IrConst::from_i64() for U32 constants in try_narrow_const()
   to preserve unsigned semantics (stores as I64 with zero-extension),
   matching the convention used elsewhere in the codebase.

Status: in_progress
