Fix VLA stack leak in loops
=============================

Problem: VLA declarations inside loop bodies leak stack space because the
stack pointer is never restored when the block scope exits. Each iteration
allocates new stack via DynAlloca but never reclaims it, causing a stack
overflow for long-running loops.

Example:
  for (i = 1; i <= 10000; i++) {
      unsigned char buf[i];  // VLA - DynAlloca each iteration
      // stack never restored at scope exit!
  }

Fix: Emit StackSave before the first VLA in a scope, and StackRestore when
that scope exits. This requires adding per-scope stack save tracking to
FuncScopeFrame and emitting StackRestore in lower_compound_stmt after
pop_scope() when the scope contained VLA declarations.

Status: IN PROGRESS
