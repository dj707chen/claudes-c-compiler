Fix stack slot collision between array and temporary variables
=============================================================

Bug: The stack slot allocator allows temporary variable slots to overlap
with array allocations. When a function has a char buf[64] on the stack
and later generates temporary values, the temporary storage can overlap
the array buffer, corrupting its contents.

Reproduction: A binary search function with guard checks before the loop
causes temps to be allocated at the same offset as buf[0], making the
search fail (key[0] gets overwritten by pos->name[0] temps stored at
the same stack offset).

Root cause: Stack slot coalescing (or initial allocation) doesn't
properly account for array sizes when checking for overlap.

Impact: This is blocking PostgreSQL's initdb from working (encoding
lookup fails due to key corruption), which blocks all 216 regression
tests.

Plan:
1. Find the stack slot allocation/coalescing code
2. Fix the overlap detection to account for array sizes
3. Add regression test
4. Verify PostgreSQL initdb works
