Fix blosc: x86 assembler jmp/jcc @PLT suffix handling

The x86 assembler's encode_jmp and encode_jcc don't strip @PLT from labels
or use R_X86_64_PLT32 relocations. This causes shared library builds to have
@PLT baked into symbol names, causing runtime "undefined symbol" errors.

Also checking if the same issue exists for i686, ARM, and RISC-V backends.
