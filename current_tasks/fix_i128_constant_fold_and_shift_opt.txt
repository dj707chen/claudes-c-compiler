Task: Fix 128-bit constant folding and shift optimization for ARM mbedtls timeout
Status: in_progress

Problem:
mbedtls ARM selftest times out because RSA operations are >1000x slower than GCC.
Root cause: The inner loop of mbedtls_mpi_core_mla does (uint128_t)(a * b) >> 64,
but our compiler:
1. Skips constant folding for all 128-bit types (constant_fold.rs line 117)
2. Always emits runtime branch-based shift code even for constant shift amounts
3. This results in ~15 branch instructions per iteration of the hottest inner loop

Fix plan:
1. Enable constant folding for 128-bit BinOp/UnaryOp/Cast in constant_fold.rs
2. Optimize ARM/RISC-V/x86 128-bit shift codegen to handle constant shift amounts
   (especially shift by 64 which is just "take the high/low word")
3. Add regression test for 128-bit multiply + shift performance
