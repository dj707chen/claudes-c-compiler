Fix __attribute__((__aligned__(...))) parsing to handle expressions

Problem: The parser only handles integer literals inside __aligned__(...).
When _Alignof(type) or other constant expressions are used (as in system
headers like max_align_t), the parser fails and desyncs, causing all
subsequent function definitions in the file to be incorrectly merged.

This breaks mbedtls compilation because psa_crypto.c includes headers
with max_align_t that uses _Alignof inside __aligned__.

Fix: Properly balance parentheses when skipping aligned attribute arguments
instead of using a simple scan that doesn't track nesting.

Also: Parse _Alignof and sizeof expressions as aligned values so that
the alignment info can be used for proper struct layout.
