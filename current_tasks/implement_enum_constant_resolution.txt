Implement enum constant resolution in the IR lowerer:

Currently, enum type specifiers are parsed (EnumVariant with name and optional value),
but enum constants (e.g., RED, GREEN, BLUE) are never registered in the lowerer.
When these identifiers appear in expressions, they are treated as undefined globals,
causing linker errors.

Plan:
1. Add a HashMap<String, i64> to the Lowerer for enum constant -> value mapping.
2. When processing enum type specifiers (in declarations and type specs),
   evaluate the enum variants and register their integer values.
3. In lower_expr for Identifier, check enum_constants before locals/globals.
4. Return IrConst::I32 for enum constants.

This will fix: enum-values-001, enum-arithmetic, and many other tests using enums.
