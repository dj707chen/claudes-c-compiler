Task: Fix typedef resolution and unsigned type widening

Problem: TypedefName was never resolved in IR lowering, causing:
1. All typedef-typed variables treated as I64 (8 bytes) regardless of actual type
2. Typedef names (e.g., size_t, uint8_t, user-defined) emitted as global variables in .bss
3. sizeof(typedef_name) always returned 8 instead of the correct size
4. unsigned char/short typedefs used sign-extension instead of zero-extension

Root cause: The Declaration AST node had no is_typedef flag, so the lowerer couldn't
distinguish typedef declarations from variable declarations. Additionally, TypedefName
was mapped to I64 in type_spec_to_ir without any resolution mechanism.

Fix applied:
- Added is_typedef field to Declaration AST struct
- Set is_typedef in parser for both global and local declarations
- Added typedefs HashMap<String, TypeSpecifier> to Lowerer struct
- Added seed_builtin_typedefs() for standard C typedef names (size_t, uint8_t, etc.)
- Added resolve_type_spec() to follow typedef chains
- Skip typedef declarations in lower_global_decl and lower_local_decl (register mapping instead)
- Updated type_spec_to_ir, type_spec_to_ctype, sizeof_type, compute_decl_info,
  and get_struct_layout_for_type to resolve typedefs before processing

Status: Complete
