Task: Fix i686 __builtin_isinf_sign I64 widen bug
Status: in_progress

Bug: On i686, __builtin_isinf_sign (and __builtin_fpclassify) produced wrong
results because narrow comparison results (I8) were used in I64 arithmetic
without zero-extension. Since I64 occupies two 32-bit stack slots on i686,
loading a narrow value as I64 read uninitialized bytes from the upper slot.

This caused json-c (and likely other projects) to misclassify finite floats
like 12.3 as Infinity.

Fix: Added widen_to_i64() helper in expr_builtins_fpclass.rs that emits
Cast(I32->I64) before I64 multiply/arithmetic operations.

Files changed:
- src/ir/lowering/expr_builtins_fpclass.rs
- tests/i686-isinf-sign-i64-widen/ (regression test)
