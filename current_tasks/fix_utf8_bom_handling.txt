Task: Fix UTF-8 BOM handling in source file reading
Status: in_progress

Problem:
The compiler does not strip the UTF-8 Byte Order Mark (BOM, bytes EF BB BF) from
the beginning of source files. This causes parse errors when C files start with a BOM,
as the BOM bytes are treated as part of the first line, corrupting preprocessor directives
like #include.

Impact:
- Fixes json-parser project (test.c has BOM)
- Also affects lame and raylib projects which have BOM in some files
- GCC and Clang both handle BOM transparently

Fix:
Strip BOM in encoding::bytes_to_string() in src/common/encoding.rs, which is the
single funnel through which all source file content passes.
