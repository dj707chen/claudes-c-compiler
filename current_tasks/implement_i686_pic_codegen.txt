Implement basic i686 PIC (Position-Independent Code) codegen

Goal: Enable the i686 backend to generate proper PIC code when -fpic/-fPIC is passed.
This is needed for the Linux kernel defconfig build with USE_MY_32=1, which compiles
vDSO32 code with -m32 -fpic. Without PIC support, the generated code has absolute
relocations that cause the kernel's vdso2c tool to reject the vDSO image.

Changes needed:
1. Add USE_MY_32 environment variable support in the driver (-m32 => Target::I686 when set)
2. GOT base register setup via __x86.get_pc_thunk.bx in function prologues
3. Reserve %ebx as GOT base register in PIC mode
4. emit_global_addr: use @GOTOFF(%ebx) for local symbols, @GOT(%ebx) for external
5. emit_call_instruction: use @PLT for non-local function calls
6. emit_label_addr: use @GOTOFF(%ebx) for local labels
