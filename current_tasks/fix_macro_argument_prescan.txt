Fix macro argument prescan and asm declaration handling.

Bug: When a macro appears in its own arguments (e.g., CAST(int, CAST(unsigned, 42))),
the inner invocation is not expanded. The C standard requires that macro arguments
are fully expanded BEFORE substitution, including expanding calls to the same macro.
The suppression of self-recursive expansion should only apply during the final rescan
of the body, not during argument prescan.

Also: The parser needs to skip __asm__("...") annotations on function declarations
in system headers (glibc pattern).

This blocks Lua compilation and all other target projects.
