Task: Deduplicate and clean up IR lowering code

Focus areas:
1. structs.rs: Merge 4 pairs of nearly-identical resolve_member_access functions
   (resolve_member_access vs resolve_pointer_member_access, etc.)
2. structs.rs: Merge overlapping arms in get_pointed_struct_layout and get_layout_for_expr
3. stmt.rs: Extract case-value truncation helper (3x copy-pasted 6-arm match)
4. expr_types.rs: Simplify sizeof_expr by delegating to get_expr_type where possible

Status: in progress
