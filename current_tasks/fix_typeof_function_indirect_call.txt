Task: Fix typeof(func_name) * producing wrong type for indirect calls
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-27

Bug: When a local variable is declared as typeof(func_name) *var, the compiler
emitted a direct call (bl var / call var) instead of an indirect call (blr reg /
call *reg). This caused kernel boot failures on ARM for arch/arm64/kernel/machine_kexec.c.

Root cause: ctype_to_type_spec(CType::Function(ft)) was producing
TypeSpecifier::FunctionPointer (which includes a pointer level), causing
typeof(add) * to resolve to Pointer(Pointer(Function(...))) instead of
Pointer(Function(...)). The is_func_ptr_variable check didn't recognize
the double-pointer type, so calls went through the direct-call path.

Fix: Added TypeSpecifier::BareFunction variant that represents a bare function
type without a pointer wrapper. ctype_to_type_spec(CType::Function) now produces
BareFunction, which resolves to CType::Function (not Pointer(Function)).
This ensures typeof(func) * correctly becomes Pointer(Function(...)).
