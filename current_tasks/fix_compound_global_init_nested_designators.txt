Fix nested designator handling in compound global initialization path.

Bug: When a struct containing a union is globally initialized with mixed positional
and designated initializers (e.g., struct S a = {2, .u.keyword={"hello", -5}}),
the compound initialization path (lower_struct_global_init_compound) discards
nested designators during the emission phase. The first designator is used
correctly to identify the field, but remaining designators (e.g., .keyword
after .u) are lost when emit_compound_field_init is called.

This causes the brace-enclosed initializer to be treated as positional for
the wrong union member, resulting in lost/zeroed fields.

Fix: Add nested designator handling to the emission phase of
lower_struct_global_init_compound, similar to how global_init_bytes.rs
handles it via fill_nested_designator_composite.

Impact: Fixes redis-server segfault on startup (corrupted command table)
and likely other struct initialization bugs with complex designated initializers.
