Fix ARM AArch64 va_arg struct register/stack boundary splitting
================================================================

Problem: When passing structs via varargs on AArch64, multi-register structs
that straddle the GP register save area / stack overflow boundary are incorrectly
split. The first slot is read from the register save area and the second from the
stack, violating AAPCS64 which requires the entire struct to come from either
registers or stack, never split.

Root cause: lower_va_arg_struct in expr_access.rs emits independent VaArg IR
instructions for each 8-byte slot of a struct on AArch64. Each VaArg independently
checks __gr_offs against 0 and decides register vs stack. When a 2-register struct
has only 1 register slot remaining, the first VaArg reads from registers and the
second from stack.

Fix: Use VaArgStruct instruction for AArch64 (like x86-64 already does) and
implement emit_va_arg_struct_impl in the ARM backend to atomically check whether
all required register slots are available.

Status: in_progress
