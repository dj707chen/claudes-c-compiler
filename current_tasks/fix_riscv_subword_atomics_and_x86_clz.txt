Fix RISC-V sub-word atomic operations and x86 CLZ(0) undefined behavior

Problem 1: RISC-V sub-word atomics
RISC-V standard ISA only provides word (32-bit) and doubleword (64-bit) atomic
instructions (AMO, LR/SC). The current backend incorrectly uses amow for I8/U8
and I16/U16 types, which operates on 32 bits and can corrupt adjacent bytes.

Fix: Implement sub-word atomics using word-aligned LR/SC with bit masking:
1. Compute word-aligned address and bit shift/mask for the sub-word field
2. Use LR.W/SC.W loop with appropriate masking to atomically modify the sub-word

Problem 2: x86 CLZ(0) undefined behavior
x86 uses BSR instruction for CLZ which has undefined behavior when input is 0.
ARM (clz) and RISC-V (software loop) correctly return 32/64 for zero inputs.

Fix: Add a zero-check branch: if input is 0, return 32 or 64; else use LZCNT
(which handles zero correctly) or BSR+XOR with a zero check.

Status: In progress
