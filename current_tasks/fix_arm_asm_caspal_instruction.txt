Fix ARM assembler: add support for CASP/CASPA/CASPL/CASPAL instructions

These are LSE (Large System Extensions) atomic compare-and-swap pair
instructions used by the Linux kernel in mm/slub.o and other core
memory management code.

The CAS (single register) family is already implemented, but the CASP
(register pair) family is missing entirely.

CASP format: caspal x0, x1, x2, x3, [x11]
  - 5 operands: compare pair (Rs, Rs+1), swap pair (Rt, Rt+1), memory [Rn]
  - Encoding: sz 001000 0 L 1 Rs o0 11111 Rn Rt
  - Key difference from CAS: bit 23 is 0 (vs 1 for CAS)

Files to modify:
- src/backend/arm/assembler/encoder/mod.rs (dispatch)
- src/backend/arm/assembler/encoder/load_store.rs (new encode_casp fn)
- src/backend/arm/codegen/peephole.rs (skip casp in register prop)
