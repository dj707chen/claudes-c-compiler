Extend the immediately-consumed stack slot optimization for RISC-V backend.

The RISC-V defconfig kernel boot crashes with stack overflow in rmqueue_bulk
because function stack frames are too large. The shared is_safe_sole_consumer()
function excluded BinOp and Cmp from the skip-slot optimization due to x86's
rhs_conflicts path. But RISC-V unconditionally loads lhs first (no register-direct
conflict paths), so BinOp lhs and Cmp lhs can safely participate.

Fix: Add a lhs_first_binop parameter to calculate_stack_space_common() that
enables BinOp/Cmp lhs as safe consumers on architectures that always load
lhs first. RISC-V passes true, all other backends pass false.
