Fix inline asm register aliasing for read-write (+) constraints.

The +r constraint outputs were not excluded from the input register pool,
causing input operands to share registers with +r outputs. This corrupted
the pre-loaded +r values during input loading.

Fix: treat '+' outputs the same as '&' (early-clobber) outputs in the
input exclusion list of assign_scratch_registers().

Fixed 25+ asm test failures across x86 involving add, sub, adc, xor,
cmov, bsr, crc32, pclmulqdq, and other instructions.
