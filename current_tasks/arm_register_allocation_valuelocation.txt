ARM Register Allocation: ValueLocation Abstraction + Register Pinning

Implementing the ValueLocation abstraction (Phase 2 from ideas/high_value_location_abstraction.txt)
plus basic register allocation for the ARM backend.

Key changes:
1. Introduce ValueLocation enum (Stack vs Register) in state.rs
2. Extend RegCache to track secondary register
3. Add liveness analysis to identify short-lived values
4. Pin short-lived ARM values to callee-saved registers instead of stack slots
5. Update ARM emit_load_operand/emit_store_result to dispatch on ValueLocation
6. Ensure x86 and RISC-V still compile (they stay on Stack-only ValueLocation)

This is the prerequisite step toward a full register allocator, focused on ARM first.
