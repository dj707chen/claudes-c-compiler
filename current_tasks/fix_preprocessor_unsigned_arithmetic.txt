Task: Fix preprocessor #if expression evaluation for unsigned integer arithmetic
Status: IN PROGRESS

Problem:
The preprocessor #if expression evaluator uses only signed i64 for all values and
completely ignores 'u'/'U' suffixes on integer literals. This causes incorrect
evaluation of:
1. Unsigned comparisons: `2147483647u < -2147483648` should be true (unsigned comparison)
   but evaluates as false (signed comparison)
2. Unsigned arithmetic: `(2u - 1) * (-2147483648)` should give unsigned multiplication
   result but gives signed result
3. Type promotions: mixing signed and unsigned in preprocessor expressions

Root cause:
In conditionals.rs, ExprToken::Num is i64 and the tokenizer skips 'u'/'U' suffixes
without recording them. All arithmetic and comparisons use signed i64 operations.

Fix:
1. Add ExprToken::UNum(u64) for unsigned literals
2. Track unsigned-ness through expression evaluation using (i64, bool) pairs
3. Apply C99 "usual arithmetic conversions" in preprocessor:
   - If either operand is unsigned, convert both to unsigned for the operation
   - Use wrapping unsigned arithmetic where appropriate
4. Fix comparisons to use unsigned comparison when either operand is unsigned

Expected impact: Fixes preprocessor #if evaluation tests involving unsigned arithmetic,
including compiler_suite_0125_0028 and potentially other tests.
