Comprehensive documentation overhaul:
- Verify all README claims against actual code
- Fix the main README to be a proper project README
- Update sub-directory READMEs with accurate information
- Fix false/outdated claims (e.g., "delegates to GCC" when there's a native assembler/linker)
- Add idea files for things that deserve cleanup
- Check TODOs and resolve any that are done
