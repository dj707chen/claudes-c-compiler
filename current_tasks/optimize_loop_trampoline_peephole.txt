Optimize eliminate_loop_trampolines peephole pass

This is the #1 performance bottleneck (19.76% of total compile time on sqlite3.c).

The main issue: For each trampoline label candidate, the function does a full
O(n) linear scan of ALL assembly lines (line 185) to find the conditional branch
targeting that label. This creates O(labels * lines) = quadratic complexity.

Fix: Pre-build a reverse index from label numbers to their conditional branch
source lines during the initial scan. This turns the inner search into O(1) lookup.

Also: Eliminate unnecessary format!() string allocations in the trampoline block
parsing code (lines 107-108, 122-123, 145) by adding a register_family_from_name
helper that doesn't require the % prefix.

Status: in_progress
