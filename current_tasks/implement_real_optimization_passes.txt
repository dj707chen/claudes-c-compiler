Implement real optimization passes (constant folding, DCE, GVN)

Currently the passes/ directory has empty stubs. The project requires
"at least one pass on the SSA" to have nontrivial code.

Plan:
1. Implement constant folding: evaluate BinOp/UnaryOp/Cmp on constant operands
2. Implement dead code elimination: remove instructions whose results are unused
3. Add a GVN (global value numbering) pass with basic CSE
4. Wire all passes into run_passes() with opt_level gating
