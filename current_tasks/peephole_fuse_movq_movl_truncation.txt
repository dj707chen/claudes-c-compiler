Task: Peephole fusion of movq+movl truncation pattern
Status: in_progress
Date: 2026-01-27

WHAT:
Fuse the two-instruction pattern:
    movq %REG, %rax          (64-bit reg-to-rax copy)
    movl %eax, %eax          (zero-extend / truncate upper 32 bits)
into a single instruction:
    movl %REGd, %eax         (32-bit copy that implicitly zero-extends)

Also handle the case where StoreRbp instructions appear between the
movq and movl (since stores don't modify %rax, the movl %eax,%eax
is still a truncation of the same value).

WHY:
In deflate.c alone, there are 280 movl %eax,%eax instructions.
230 of those are immediately preceded by movq %REG, %rax.
41 are preceded by a StoreRbp (store doesn't modify rax).
These come from the Cast(i64->u32) codegen path which always goes
through the rax accumulator.

FILES:
- src/backend/x86/codegen/peephole/types.rs - add ExtKind for movq-to-rax
- src/backend/x86/codegen/peephole/passes.rs - add fusion pattern
