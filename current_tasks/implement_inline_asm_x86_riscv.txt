Task: Implement inline assembly support for x86 and RISC-V backends
Status: IN PROGRESS

Problem: The x86 and RISC-V backends have stub implementations for inline assembly
that only emit a comment. This causes 122+ test failures on x86 and 116 on RISC-V
where inline asm operands are never substituted or connected to actual registers.

The ARM backend already has a working implementation that:
1. Allocates scratch registers for operands
2. Loads input values into assigned registers
3. Substitutes %0, %1, %[name] in templates with register names
4. Stores output register values back to stack slots

Fix: Implement the same pattern for x86 and RISC-V:
- x86: Use r8-r15, rcx, rdx as scratch registers. Support %0/%1/%[name] substitution
  with modifiers like %k (32-bit), %w (16-bit), %b (8-bit low), %h (8-bit high).
- RISC-V: Use t0-t6, a0-a7 as scratch registers. Support %0/%1/%[name] substitution.

Expected impact: ~122 x86 asm test fixes, ~60+ RISC-V asm test fixes.
