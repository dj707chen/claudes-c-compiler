Task: Fix _Atomic(type) specifier to parse actual inner type

Problem: _Atomic(type-name) in the parser was discarding the inner type
and returning TypeSpecifier::Int regardless. This means _Atomic(long) was
treated as int, _Atomic(char) was treated as int, etc.

Fix: Parse the actual inner type inside _Atomic(...) parentheses using
the recursive type parser, and return the resolved type specifier.

Status: in_progress
