Fix F128 indirect pointer load/store on ARM and RISC-V

Bug: When loading F128 (long double) values from non-alloca pointers
(e.g., array element computed via GEP), the ARM and RISC-V backends
incorrectly treated the Direct stack slot as containing F128 data
when it actually contained an 8-byte pointer that needed dereferencing.

This affected long double _Complex operations where array elements
are accessed via variable indices and passed to functions.

Also fixes emit_load_with_const_offset for F128 to handle register-
assigned bases by loading from the register + offset instead of
trying to use the (possibly dummy) stack slot.
