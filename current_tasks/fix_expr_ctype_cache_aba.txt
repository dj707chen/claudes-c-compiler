Fix expr_ctype_cache ABA address-reuse bug causing kernel miscompilation

Root cause: expr_ctype_cache used raw pointer addresses as keys. Expressions
inside TypeSpecifier trees (typeof, _Generic) cached during typeof resolution
could share addresses with different Expr variants in the main AST, causing
stale cache hits that returned the wrong CType. This made lower_deref suppress
Load instructions for volatile pointer dereferences in the kernel READ_ONCE
macro, producing lea (address) instead of mov (load).

Fix: Store Expr discriminant alongside cached value; validate on cache hit.
Discriminant mismatch triggers recomputation instead of returning stale data.

Status: in progress
