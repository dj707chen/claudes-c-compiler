Implementing #include file resolution in the preprocessor.

Currently, #include directives just record the path and strip the line.
This task implements actual file reading and recursive preprocessing:

1. When #include <file.h> or #include "file.h" is encountered:
   - Search for the file in include paths (current dir for "", then -I paths, then system paths)
   - Read the file contents
   - Recursively preprocess the included file
   - Insert the preprocessed content into the output

2. Include path search order:
   - For "file.h": directory of the including file first
   - -I paths in order specified
   - System include paths (/usr/include, /usr/local/include)
   - Cross-compiler paths for ARM/RISC-V targets

3. Include guards:
   - Track #pragma once
   - The existing #ifdef/#ifndef handling already works for traditional include guards

4. Recursion protection:
   - Track currently-being-included files to prevent infinite recursion

This is critical for compiling any real-world project (Lua, zlib, etc.)
since all macros, type definitions, and declarations come from headers.
