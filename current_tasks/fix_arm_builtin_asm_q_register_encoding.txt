Task: Fix ARM builtin assembler Q register (128-bit SIMD) encoding

The builtin ARM assembler was encoding `ldr q0`/`str q0` as `ldr b0`/`str b0`
(8-bit byte operations instead of 128-bit quadword operations). 

Root cause: For AArch64 LDR/STR of 128-bit Q registers, the encoding requires:
- size=0b00 in bits [31:30] 
- opc=0b11 for load (not 0b01 which gives byte load)
- opc=0b10 for store (not 0b00 which gives byte store)
- offset shift=4 (for 16-byte alignment)
But encode_ldr_str was treating size=0b00 the same as ldrb/strb.

Fix: Added is_128bit parameter to encode_ldr_str, adjusting opc and shift
for all addressing modes (unsigned offset, unscaled, pre-index, post-index,
register offset, :lo12: relocation).

Status: in_progress
