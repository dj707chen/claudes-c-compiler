Fix x86 kernel tinyconfig build with standalone assembler/linker.

Issues to fix:
1. split_macro_args doesn't respect quoted strings (causes "jmp, "cmp, ".byte errors)
2. symbol = expr assignment syntax not parsed (L4_PAGE_OFFSET = expr)
3. Missing instructions: lldt, lar, invlpg, fxsave, fxsaveq, swapgs
4. lgdtl with label operand (needs to treat label as memory)
5. db0-db7 debug register support for mov
6. btsl unsupported operand form
7. unsupported push operand
