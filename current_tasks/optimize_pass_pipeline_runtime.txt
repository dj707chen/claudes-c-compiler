Task: Optimize Pass Pipeline Runtime Performance
Status: in_progress

Goal: Speed up the compiler's optimization pass pipeline by:
1. Skipping expensive passes (GVN, LICM, if-convert) on single-block functions
   since they can't have inter-block optimization opportunities
2. Adding per-function change tracking to skip unmodified functions in
   subsequent iterations of the 3-iteration pipeline
3. Early-exit from individual per-function passes when the function is trivially
   small (no instructions beyond the terminator)

Expected impact: 15-25% reduction in opt pass time (currently ~0.45s on sqlite3.c)
