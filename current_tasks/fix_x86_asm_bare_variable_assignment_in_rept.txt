Fix x86 assembler: bare `symbol = expression` assignments not tracked during preprocessing.

The x86 kernel uses `i = 0` and `i = i + 1` inside `.rept` loops (e.g., head_64.S
early_idt_handler_array, entry_64.S irq_entries_start). These bare assignment forms
are only recognized late in parse_line_items as raw aliases, not during the
expand_gas_macros preprocessing phase where `.set` is handled.

This means the variable value is never progressively updated across .rept iterations,
causing `i` and `vector` to appear as undefined symbol references.

Fix: Make expand_gas_macros_with_state recognize `symbol = expression` lines
the same way it recognizes `.set symbol, expression` and track them in the
symbols HashMap for progressive evaluation.

This is the root cause of x86 kernel link errors:
- undefined reference to `i` (head_64.S early_idt_handler_array)
- undefined reference to `vector` (idtentry.h irq_entries_start)
- undefined reference to `pgtno` (head_64.S)
