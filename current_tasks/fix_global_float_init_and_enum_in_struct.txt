Task: Fix global float/double initialization, enum in struct, array size expressions, and designated initializer ordering

Status: IN PROGRESS

Changes:
1. Global float/double initialization coercion: Integer constants used as initializers 
   for float/double globals are now properly converted to their IEEE 754 representation.
   (e.g., `double x = 100;` now emits `.xword 4636737291354636288` instead of `.xword 100`)

2. Enum constants in struct/union definitions: `collect_enum_constants()` now recurses 
   into struct/union field definitions to extract nested enum constants.
   (e.g., `struct { enum { X } x; } s;` now makes `X` available)

3. Array size constant expression evaluation: `expr_as_array_size()` now falls back to
   `eval_const_expr()` for complex expressions like `sizeof(int) + sizeof(long)`.

4. Designated initializer ordering in global struct init: Fixed `fill_struct_global_bytes()` 
   to not terminate early when designated initializers reference out-of-order fields.
   (e.g., `{ .b = 2, .a = 1 }` now correctly initializes both fields)
