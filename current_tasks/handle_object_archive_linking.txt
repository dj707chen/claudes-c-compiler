Task: Handle .o/.a files and linker flags in driver

The driver currently treats all input files as C source and tries to compile them.
When given object files (.o), archive files (.a), or linker flags (-l, -L),
the driver should pass these directly to the linker rather than trying to compile them.

This is critical for building real projects like Lua, which compile individual .c files
to .o objects with -c, then link them together in a final step:
  ccc -o lua lua.o liblua.a -lm

Changes needed:
1. Classify input files by extension (.c -> compile, .o/.a -> pass to linker)
2. Collect -l and -L flags and pass to the linker
3. Update linker interfaces to accept extra arguments (libs, archive files)
4. All three backends (x86, arm, riscv) need updating

Status: In progress
