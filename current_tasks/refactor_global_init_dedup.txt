Refactor global initialization: unify duplicated struct traversal

The global init code has the same struct-field-traversal algorithm duplicated 4 times
across global_init_bytes.rs and global_init_compound.rs, each targeting a different
output format (byte buffer, compound vec, or hybrid). This creates ~400-500 lines of
duplicated code where every bug fix must be applied in multiple places.

Plan:
1. Create an InitEmitter trait with methods for emitting scalars, pointers, and zero-fill
2. Implement ByteEmitter, CompoundEmitter, HybridEmitter
3. Unify the 4 struct-walk functions into one generic walk_struct_init
4. Unify the 5 designator-drilling implementations into one drill_designators helper
5. Extract repeated resolve_init_expr pattern into single method
6. Remove dead code (unreachable bitfield block in compound path)
