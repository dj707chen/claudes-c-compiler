Refactor: Deduplicate global_init_bytes.rs and global_init_compound.rs

Problem:
The global_init subsystem has massive structural duplication across its three files
(global_init.rs, global_init_bytes.rs, global_init_compound.rs - 3946 lines total).
The bytes path and compound path implement nearly identical struct/array iteration,
designator resolution, field dispatch, and anonymous member handling logic in parallel.
Key patterns like designator name extraction, anonymous member detection, nested
designator checks, and [N].field processing loops are copied 3-10 times each.

Plan:
1. Extract shared helper functions for repeated patterns:
   - Designator name extraction
   - Anonymous member designator detection
   - Nested field designator detection
   - has_array_field_designators check
   - Address resolution cascade
2. Unify the parallel struct field iteration into a single traversal that can
   dispatch to either the bytes or compound output path via a trait or callback.
3. Consolidate the [N].field designator processing loop (duplicated 2x in compound).
4. Add lowering/ README documenting the global init architecture.

Expected result: ~500-800 lines removed, significantly less duplication,
clearer separation of "what fields to initialize" from "how to serialize them".
