Task: Refactor global_init_bytes.rs and global_init_compound.rs to eliminate structural duplication

Problem:
The global initialization subsystem has two parallel implementations:
- global_init_bytes.rs (1255 lines): serializes initializers into byte buffers
- global_init_compound.rs (1468 lines): serializes into Vec<GlobalInit> with relocations

Both implement nearly identical control flow for:
- Field iteration with current_field_idx tracking
- Designator resolution via layout.resolve_init_field()
- Anonymous member detection and recursive delegation
- Nested designator chains
- Array field flat-init detection
- Union handling
- Bitfield packing

Approach:
1. Extract the shared struct-walking logic into fill_struct_global_bytes (bytes path)
   being the canonical walker, with compound calling into bytes for non-pointer fields
   (it already does this in emit_sub_struct_to_compound).
2. Reduce compound's top-level method to only handle the compound-specific concerns
   (pointer field detection, relocation tracking, padding emission).
3. Remove duplicated helper functions and consolidate shared utilities.
4. Target: ~400-600 lines saved while preserving all functionality.
