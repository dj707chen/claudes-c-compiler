Refactor: Unify duplicated codegen option dispatch in backend/mod.rs

STATUS: in_progress

PROBLEM:
- generate_assembly_with_opts() and generate_assembly_with_opts_and_debug() in
  backend/mod.rs are nearly identical, duplicating all option-setting logic for
  all 4 backends (86 lines of duplication).
- generate_assembly_with_options() is a third older API that also duplicates.
- Each backend independently defines identical set_pic() and set_no_jump_tables()
  one-liner setter methods.

FIX:
- Eliminate generate_assembly_with_opts() and generate_assembly_with_options()
  by having them delegate to generate_assembly_with_opts_and_debug() (the most
  general form).
- Add an apply_options() method to each backend struct to centralize option
  application, removing duplication from the dispatch function.
- Clean up stale completed task files in current_tasks/.
