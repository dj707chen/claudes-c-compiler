Task: Eliminate unused static globals and their static function dependencies
Status: in_progress

Problem:
Our compiler emits unused static const globals (and their static function
dependencies) even when they're never referenced. GCC eliminates these.

This causes link failures in the kernel when an unused static const struct
(e.g., sctp_csum_ops in net/sctp/checksum.h) references extern symbols
(e.g., crc32c) that aren't available in the link unit.

Reproduction:
- net/netfilter/nf_nat_proto.c includes net/sctp/checksum.h which defines
  a static const struct sctp_csum_ops with function pointers to static inline
  functions that call extern crc32c(). Since CONFIG_NF_CT_PROTO_SCTP is not
  defined, the only user of sctp_csum_ops is ifdef'd out, so the struct is unused.
- GCC eliminates the unused static const struct and its dependencies.
- Our compiler keeps them, creating an undefined reference to crc32c at link time.

Fix:
Add a pass to eliminate unused static globals. After IR lowering, identify
static globals that are never referenced by any non-static function or other
referenced global, and remove them along with any static functions they
exclusively reference.
