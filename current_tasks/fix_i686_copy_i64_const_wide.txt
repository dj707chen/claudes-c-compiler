Fix i686 Copy from IrConst::I64 spurious wide marking

On i686, the codegen was incorrectly marking Copy instruction destinations
as "wide" (64-bit) when the source was IrConst::I64, which is the universal
container for ALL integer constants regardless of semantic type. This caused
32-bit int variables to be treated as 64-bit values, leading to:
- Uninitialized upper 32 bits being checked in zero tests
- `if (0)` evaluating as true when upper bits contained garbage

This fix changes the Copy wide-marking logic to only treat IrConst::I64
constants as wide when the value doesn't fit in a 32-bit integer.

Status: in_progress
