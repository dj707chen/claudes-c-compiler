Fix ARM assembler: branches to global symbols in same section missing relocations

Bug: The ARM/AArch64 assembler resolves bl/b instructions to global symbols within
the same section at assembly time instead of emitting R_AARCH64_CALL26/JUMP26
relocations. GAS always emits relocations for global symbols.

Root cause: In elf_writer.rs, the triage logic at line 643 uses:
    if is_local || is_branch_reloc_type(elf_type)
This unconditionally defers ALL branch instructions, and resolve_local_branches
then resolves same-section references directly without checking if the target
is a global symbol.

The x86 assembler handles this correctly (checks is_local_symbol before resolving),
and the RISC-V assembler only defers syntactically local symbols (.L* prefixed).

Fix: In resolve_local_branches(), check if the target symbol is global before
resolving in-place. If global, emit a relocation instead.
