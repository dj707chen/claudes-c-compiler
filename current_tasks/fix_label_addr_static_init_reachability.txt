Fix: &&label in static local initializers made unreachable by CFG simplify

When &&label appears in a static local variable initializer (e.g.,
static void *table[] = { &&my_label }), the label address is stored as a
GlobalInit::GlobalAddr in the .data section. However, the CFG simplify pass
only checked Instruction::LabelAddr for reachability, not global initializer
references. This caused the label's block to be removed as dead code,
resulting in linker errors like "undefined reference to '.L3'".

Fix: Track global_init_label_blocks in IrFunction and check them during
CFG simplify reachability analysis and block merging prevention.

Status: in_progress
