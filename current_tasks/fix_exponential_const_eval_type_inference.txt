Fix exponential-time constant expression evaluation

Problem: enum value expressions like `+1+1+1+...+1` (43 terms in jq's execute.c)
cause the compiler to hang. The root cause is in SemaConstEval::eval_const_expr()
for BinaryOp: it calls infer_expr_ctype() on both operands to determine the
result type for usual arithmetic conversions. Since the enum expressions haven't
been walked by analyze_expr(), the ExprTypeChecker's memoization cache is empty,
causing O(2^N) recursive type inference.

Fix: Derive operand types from the already-evaluated IrConst values instead of
re-inferring them from the AST. For integer constants, the type (int/long/unsigned)
is known from the IrConst variant. This avoids the exponential blowup entirely.

Also add analyze_expr() calls before enum constant evaluation so the cache is
populated for any remaining cases.

Impact: Unblocks jq build (was timing out at 60s), likely affects other projects
with similar enum patterns.
