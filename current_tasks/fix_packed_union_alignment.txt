Fix __attribute__((__packed__)) on unions not reducing alignment to 1

Bug: When __packed__ attribute is applied to a union type declaration,
the union's alignment should be reduced to 1 (same as for structs).
Currently, packed structs correctly get alignment 1, but packed unions
keep their natural alignment.

Example:
  union u { int a; } __attribute__((__packed__));
  // Expected: alignof(union u) = 1
  // Actual: alignof(union u) = 4

This causes sizeof(struct s { char c; union u u; }) to be 8 instead of 5.

Fix: Apply the same packed-alignment-reduction logic to unions as we do for structs.
