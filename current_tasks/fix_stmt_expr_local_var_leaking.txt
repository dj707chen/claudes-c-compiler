Fix statement expression local variables leaking as global symbol references
============================================================================
Status: in_progress
Date: 2026-01-30

Problem:
Local variables declared inside statement expressions (({ ... })) like ____ptr
and __v are being emitted as global symbol references instead of stack-local
variables, causing undefined reference linker errors when building the Linux kernel.

This is the primary remaining blocker for the kernel build after the
__compiletime_assert fix.

Plan:
1. Investigate how statement expression variables are registered and looked up
2. Fix the scope/lookup issue to keep them local
3. Add regression test
4. Verify kernel builds successfully
