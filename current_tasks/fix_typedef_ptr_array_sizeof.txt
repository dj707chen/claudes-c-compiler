Fix typedef'd pointer type array sizeof and global BSS size

Bug: When declaring an array of a typedef'd pointer type, e.g.:
  typedef struct Foo *FooPtr;
  FooPtr arr[10];

The compiler treats sizeof(arr) as sizeof(FooPtr) = 8, instead of
10 * sizeof(FooPtr) = 80. This causes global BSS allocations to be
too small, leading to overlapping symbols and memory corruption.

This is a critical bug affecting PostgreSQL's initdb bootstrap, where
Form_pg_attribute attrtypes[MAXATTR] (a typedef'd pointer array)
gets only 8 bytes instead of 320, causing adjacent globals to overlap
and corrupting pointer values to small integers like 0x1 or 0x2.

Root cause: The parser/type system loses the array dimension when the
base type is a typedef'd pointer. The CType for the array variable
becomes just a pointer instead of an array-of-pointers.
