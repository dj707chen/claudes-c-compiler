Fix blosc project: shared library linker drops weak binding for undefined symbols.
ZSTD_trace_* weak symbols become strong undefined (U) instead of weak undefined (w) in .dynsym.
This causes runtime "undefined symbol" errors when the dynamic linker tries to resolve them.
Fix needed in x86 (and potentially other arch) shared library linker code.
