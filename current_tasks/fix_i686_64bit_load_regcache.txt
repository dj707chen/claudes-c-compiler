Fix i686 64-bit GEP-folded load missing reg_cache invalidation

Problem: On i686, when a 64-bit struct field is loaded after a 32-bit field
from the same struct (via GEP-folded loads), the reg_cache incorrectly
retains the stale entry from the 32-bit load. The 64-bit load path in
emit_load_with_const_offset_impl writes to %eax:%edx but does NOT call
reg_cache.invalidate_acc(), causing subsequent reads of the 32-bit value
to skip the reload (using the stale %eax which now holds the 64-bit low word).

This causes zstd's ZSTD_decompressBound to fail on i686 (test 6 in fuzzer).

Fix: Add self.state.reg_cache.invalidate_acc() after emit_store_acc_pair
in the I64/U64/F64 branch of emit_load_with_const_offset_impl, matching
what emit_load_impl already does.
