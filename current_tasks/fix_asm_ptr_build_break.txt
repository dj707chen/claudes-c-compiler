Fix build-breaking undefined variable `asm_ptr` in stmt_asm.rs

Commit 72c5fca introduced references to `asm_ptr` in stmt_asm.rs lines 123
and 125, but never defined the variable, causing a compile error that prevents
the entire compiler from building.

The fix is to remove the dead code block since in the else branch where the
broken code lives, `ptr` is always the original variable alloca (from
lower_lvalue), and there's no separate temp alloca to store into. The temp
alloca case is handled by the is_global_reg branch above.
