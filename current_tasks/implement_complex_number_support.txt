Task: Implement _Complex type support
Status: IN PROGRESS (taken over - previous lock had no implementation commits)

Goal: Add basic _Complex number support to unlock 500+ failing test cases.

Scope of this PR:
1. Add ComplexFloat, ComplexDouble, ComplexLongDouble to CType and TypeSpecifier
2. Wire up has_complex flag in parser type resolution
3. Add imaginary literal tokens (ImaginaryFloat, ImaginaryDouble, ImaginaryLongDouble)
4. Represent complex types in IR as pairs of floats on stack
5. Implement complex arithmetic (+, -, *, /) as component-wise ops
6. Add __real__ and __imag__ unary operators
7. Add creal/cimag/crealf/cimagf/creall/cimagl as builtins
8. Provide minimal complex.h header support
9. Handle complex type conversions and assignments
