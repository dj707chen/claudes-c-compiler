Fix: Sema struct layout scoping

Bug: When a function defines a local struct with the same tag name as a
global struct (but different fields), the global layout is permanently
corrupted. This is because sema's resolve_struct_or_union uses
insert_struct_layout_from_ref (unscoped) to register struct layouts,
and sema never pushes/pops TypeContext scopes.

Fix:
1. Push/pop TypeContext scopes in sema at function entry/exit,
   compound statement boundaries, and for-loop scopes
2. Use insert_struct_layout_scoped_from_ref instead of
   insert_struct_layout_from_ref in resolve_struct_or_union

This ensures inner struct definitions are properly undone when their
scope exits, preserving global layouts.
