Fix __builtin_unreachable() and __builtin_trap() to emit Terminator::Unreachable
in the IR instead of generating a call to abort(). This is critical for kernel
compilation where abort() doesn't exist. The correct behavior is to emit a ud2
(x86) / brk #0 (ARM) / ebreak (RISC-V) trap instruction.

Currently these builtins are mapped to BuiltinKind::LibcAlias("abort") which
generates a call to the abort function. This creates an undefined symbol reference
in kernel code and can cause boot failures.
