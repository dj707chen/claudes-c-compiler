Enhance i686 peephole compare+branch fusion to handle store/load patterns

Currently the i686 peephole's fuse_compare_and_branch bails out when there's a
StoreEbp between the movzbl and testl. The x86-64 version handles this case by
tracking store offsets and verifying each has a matching load nearby, allowing
fusion even when the boolean is temporarily spilled.

Port the x86-64's more sophisticated compare+branch fusion logic to i686,
which will eliminate many setcc+movzbl+store+load+test+jne sequences in
the generated code, significantly reducing code size for the Linux kernel
16-bit boot code.
