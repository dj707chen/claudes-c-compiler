Task: Fix multi-dimensional array support in IR lowering

Currently, multi-dimensional arrays (e.g., int a[2][3]) are broken:
1. compute_decl_info only processes the first Array dimension, so allocation is wrong
2. Nested array subscript (a[i][j]) incorrectly loads from intermediate addresses
3. elem_size is wrong for outer array dimensions (uses base type size instead of row size)

Changes needed:
- Track array dimensions in LocalInfo (new field: array_dims: Vec<usize>)
- Fix compute_decl_info to compute total size across all dimensions
- Fix compute_array_element_addr to handle nested subscripts as address computations
- Fix get_array_elem_size and get_array_base_addr for multi-dim arrays

Status: In progress
