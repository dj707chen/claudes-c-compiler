Fix three parsing/lowering bugs:

1. Parenthesized array parameter parsing: int (*a[]) was parsed as int *a instead of int **a.
   The array dimensions inside parenthesized parameter declarators were being skipped entirely
   instead of being propagated for proper array-to-pointer decay.

2. Typedef'd multi-dimensional array struct layout: when a typedef embeds array dimensions
   (e.g., typedef struct s tyst[2][2]), the struct layout resolution only unwrapped one
   level of CType::Array, failing to find the innermost struct type for multi-dimensional arrays.

3. C99 VLA star syntax: [*] and [const *] in function parameter array declarators were not
   handled, causing parse errors.
