Fix 128-bit compound assignment operators (|=, +=, &=, <<=, etc.)

The usual_arithmetic_conversions function in expr.rs always returns op_ty=I64
for integer types, even when operands are 128-bit. This causes compound assignments
on __uint128_t / __int128 types to truncate to 64 bits, losing the upper half.

This breaks mbedtls bignum division (which uses __attribute__((mode(TI))) for
128-bit types), causing the selftest to fail/hang.

Fix: Update usual_arithmetic_conversions to preserve I128/U128 as op_ty,
matching the pattern already used in lower_arithmetic_binop.
