Implementing driver compilation modes (-S, -c, -E, -D flags)

These are fundamental GCC-compatible driver features currently marked as TODO.
- -S: Output assembly text to file (no assemble/link)
- -c: Compile to object file (no link)
- -E: Preprocess only, output to stdout
- -D: Command-line macro defines (passed to preprocessor)

This involves:
1. Adding CompilationMode enum to driver
2. Updating main.rs arg parsing
3. Updating driver.rs pipeline to stop at the right phase
4. Updating preprocessor to accept external defines
