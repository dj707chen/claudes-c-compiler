Task: Add constant-condition branch folding to CFG simplification pass

Problem:
Many kernel files fail to compile because inline assembly in switch(sizeof(T))
macros (cmpxchg, xchg, etc.) generates code for all switch branches. The dead
branches contain type-mismatched inline assembly (e.g., byte-sized register with
32-bit instruction suffix) which causes the assembler to error.

Root cause:
After mem2reg promotes the switch alloca to an SSA value, and constant folding
folds `Cmp(Eq, Const(sizeof), Const(case_val))` to `Copy(Const(0/1))`, and
copy propagation puts the constant into the CondBranch condition, the CFG
simplifier does NOT convert `CondBranch { cond: Const(nonzero), A, B }` into
`Branch(A)`. This means dead switch branches remain in the IR and get codegen'd.

Fix:
Add a new sub-pass to cfg_simplify.rs that converts CondBranch with a known
constant condition into an unconditional Branch to the correct target. This
enables dead block removal to eliminate the unreachable branches.
