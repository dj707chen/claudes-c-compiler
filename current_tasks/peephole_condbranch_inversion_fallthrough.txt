Task: Add conditional branch inversion for fall-through optimization
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-30

Description:
Add a peephole optimization pass to all backends (x86, ARM, RISC-V) that
inverts conditional branches when the true target is the next (fall-through)
label.

Currently the codegen emits:
    jCC .Ltrue
    jmp .Lfalse
.Ltrue:

This can be optimized to:
    j!CC .Lfalse
.Ltrue:

This saves one instruction per conditional branch where the true target
immediately follows. This is extremely common in loop headers and if-else
chains, and will reduce code size and improve performance (fewer jumps,
better branch prediction for fall-through paths).
