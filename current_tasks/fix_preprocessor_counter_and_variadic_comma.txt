Task: Fix preprocessor __COUNTER__ and named variadic comma elision

Description:
Two preprocessor bugs prevent many kernel files from compiling:

1. __COUNTER__ macro not implemented - should expand to incrementing integers (0, 1, 2, ...)
   on each use. Used extensively in Linux kernel instrumentation/tracing macros.

2. GNU extension ", ## args" comma elision not working for named variadic parameters.
   For macros like `#define FOO(a, b, args...) bar(a, b, ## args)`, when args is empty,
   the preceding comma should be removed (same as , ## __VA_ARGS__). This was only
   implemented for __VA_ARGS__, not for named variadic parameters like `args...`.

Files changed:
- src/frontend/preprocessor/macro_defs.rs

Status: In progress
