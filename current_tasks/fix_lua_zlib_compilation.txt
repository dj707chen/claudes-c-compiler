Task: Fix Lua and zlib compilation (in progress)

Fixes:
1. Preprocessor char literal evaluation in #if directives
2. Computed goto support (&&label / goto *expr) - GCC extension
3. Pointer-to-pointer chained subscript stride computation
4. 2D array dimension ordering in struct field declarations
5. Struct pointer dereference not skipping Load for aggregates
6. Labels-as-values in static initializers (emit as GlobalAddr)
7. offsetof not evaluatable as compile-time constant
8. sizeof(struct_member_array) returning pointer size instead of full array

Results:
- Lua: 6/6 tests pass
- zlib: 2/2 tests pass
