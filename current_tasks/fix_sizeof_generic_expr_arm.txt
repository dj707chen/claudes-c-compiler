Task: Fix sizeof(_Generic(...)) always returning 4 on all architectures
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-27

Problem: sizeof(_Generic(...)) always returns 4 regardless of selected type.
The IR lowerer's sizeof_expr() in expr_types.rs has no explicit handling for 
GenericSelection expressions, so the default catch-all returns 4.

This causes kernel boot failures on ARM (and likely all arches) because:
- READ_ONCE/WRITE_ONCE use _Generic + typeof to determine type for volatile loads
- sizeof on typeof(_Generic(...)) returns 4 instead of 8 for 64-bit types
- switch(sizeof(...)) selects wrong inline asm instruction (4-byte load vs 8-byte)
- Corrupts 64-bit values like kernel pointers, causing boot hangs

Verified failing files:
- mm/compaction.c (ARM, seed 42)
- kernel/sched/core.c (ARM, seed 7)

Fix: Add GenericSelection case to sizeof_expr() that resolves the selected
association and returns sizeof of the resolved type.

Note: Overlaps with fix_sizeof_generic_selection.txt which was locked 
>1.3 hours ago without any fix being pushed. Taking separate lock to 
ensure this critical bug gets fixed.
