Task: Implement native AArch64 assembler scaffold

Goal: Write a built-in AArch64 (ARM64) assembler that can parse .s files generated
by the ARM backend and produce ELF .o object files, replacing the need for
aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc as an external assembler.

This includes:
- Parser for AArch64 assembly (.s format as emitted by our codegen)
- AArch64 instruction encoder (ARMv8-A instruction set)
- ELF object file writer with proper relocations
- Integration via MY_ASM environment variable
- scripts/compare_asm.py for comparing output with GCC assembler

Status: in progress
