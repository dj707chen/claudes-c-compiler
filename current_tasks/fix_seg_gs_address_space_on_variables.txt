Task: fix_seg_gs_address_space_on_variables
Status: in_progress
Description: Fix __seg_gs address space qualifier being lost for non-pointer variable declarations.

Bug: When a variable is declared with __seg_gs (e.g., `extern const struct pcpu_hot __seg_gs const_pcpu_hot`),
the address space qualifier is only captured for pointer types (via the star `*` in declarations).
For non-pointer struct variables, __seg_gs is parsed but never stored in the AST or symbol table.

This means accessing members of __seg_gs variables (e.g., `const_pcpu_hot.current_task`) generates
normal loads instead of %gs:-prefixed loads, causing incorrect per-CPU data access in the Linux kernel.

Impact: kernel/sched/core.c boot hang - get_current() returns garbage because it reads from
the wrong memory location (missing %gs: segment prefix on per-CPU variable access).

Fix plan:
1. Add address_space field to Declaration AST node
2. Store parsing_address_space into Declaration even without pointer star
3. Add address_space field to VarInfo/GlobalInfo in IR lowering
4. Propagate address space through member access (`.` operator) in lower_member_access_impl
5. Propagate address space through lvalue member access in lower_lvalue

Files to modify:
- src/frontend/parser/ast.rs (Declaration struct)
- src/frontend/parser/declarations.rs (store address_space in Declaration)
- src/ir/lowering/definitions.rs (VarInfo/GlobalInfo)
- src/ir/lowering/lowering.rs (propagate to VarInfo/GlobalInfo)
- src/ir/lowering/expr.rs (lower_member_access_impl)
- src/ir/lowering/lvalue.rs (lower_lvalue MemberAccess)
