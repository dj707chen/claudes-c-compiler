Fix sema: struct member access check gives false errors when struct tag is shadowed in inner scope.

When an inner scope redefines `struct T`, the sema's check_member_exists function incorrectly
uses the inner scope's layout for variables declared with the outer scope's `struct T`. This
causes false "has no member named" errors. Fix: skip the member check when the struct tag is
currently shadowed.
