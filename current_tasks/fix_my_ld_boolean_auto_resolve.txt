Fix MY_LD=1 (boolean flag) to auto-resolve the correct ld binary path.

Currently MY_LD expects a full path to the ld binary (e.g., MY_LD=/usr/bin/ld).
When MY_LD=1 is set (as a boolean "enable direct linking" flag), the compiler
tries to run "1" as the linker binary, which fails.

Fix: When MY_LD is set but its value is not a valid path to an executable,
automatically resolve the correct ld binary for each architecture:
- x86-64: ld (native)
- i686: i686-linux-gnu-ld or ld
- aarch64: aarch64-linux-gnu-ld or ld
- riscv64: riscv64-linux-gnu-ld or ld
