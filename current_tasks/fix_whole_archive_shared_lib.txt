Implement --whole-archive / --no-whole-archive support in the builtin linker.

Bug: When building a shared library from a .a archive (e.g., libtool's
  ccc-x86 -shared -Wl,--whole-archive libfoo.a -Wl,--no-whole-archive -o libfoo.so
), the archive members are not extracted because resolve_archive_members() only
pulls in members that resolve existing undefined symbols. With --whole-archive,
ALL members should be extracted unconditionally.

This breaks squashfuse and other projects that use libtool to build shared libraries
from convenience archives.

Fix:
1. Parse --whole-archive / --no-whole-archive flags in all linker arg parsers
2. Pass whole_archive state to load_archive_elf64() and load_thin_archive_elf64()
3. When whole_archive is true, bypass demand-driven extraction and add ALL members

Affects: x86, i686, ARM, RISC-V linkers
