Fix -Wreturn-type: enum constant eval in while(true) and segment scanning past null statements

Two remaining -Wreturn-type false positives blocking the Linux kernel build:

1. Enum constant evaluation in try_eval_constant_bool()
   - Linux kernel defines true/false as enum constants: enum { false = 0, true = 1 };
   - while(true) is not recognized as an infinite loop because try_eval_constant_bool
     only handles integer literals, not enum constant identifiers
   - Fix: Look up Expr::Identifier names in the enum_constants table
   - Affected files: interval_tree.c (4 errors), xz_dec_stream.c (1 error)

2. Switch segment outcome scanning past trailing null statements
   - Macros like RETURN_ERROR(...) expand to: do { return ...; } while(0);
   - When used as the last case in a switch, the trailing semicollon after while(0)
     creates an empty/null statement: do { return ...; } while(0);;
   - segment_outcome() only checks the LAST BlockItem in a segment
   - The last BlockItem is the null statement (falls through), not the do-while (returns)
   - Fix: scan backwards past Stmt::Expr(None) and similar empty statements
   - Affected files: zstd_decompress.c, zstd_decompress_block.c (3 errors)

Together these fix 8 of the 9 remaining -Wreturn-type errors (the 9th is workqueue.c
which needs investigation into -DKBUILD_MODNAME interaction).
