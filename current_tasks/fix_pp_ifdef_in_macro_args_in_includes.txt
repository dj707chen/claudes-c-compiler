Fix Preprocessor #ifdef Inside Macro Arguments in Included Files

When a macro invocation spans multiple lines and contains #ifdef/#endif
directives within its arguments, the preprocessor incorrectly handles this
when the code is in an #include'd file. It flushes the pending multi-line
accumulation buffer when it encounters the conditional directive, causing
the macro invocation to be split and only partially expanded.

Example:
  // header.h
  #define FOO(x...) { x }
  #define BAR 1
  int arr[] = FOO(
      1,
  #ifdef BAR
      2,
  #endif
      3
  );

When #include'd, ccc -E produces "{ 1, }" instead of "{ 1, 2, 3 }".
When the same code is directly in a .c file, it works correctly.

The fix is in preprocess_source() in preprocessor.rs: instead of flushing
the pending line when a conditional directive is encountered during include
processing, process the conditional directive and continue accumulating.
Lines in inactive conditional blocks should be skipped (not accumulated),
while lines in active blocks continue to be accumulated into pending_line.
