Fix Emacs_Lisp_core project build

Root cause: _Static_assert is not handled as a struct member declaration in
parse_struct_fields() (types.rs). When _Static_assert(sizeof(type), ...) appears
inside a struct body, the parser treats `type` as a struct field declaration
and then errors out expecting ';' instead of ')'.

Fix: Add a check for TokenKind::StaticAssert in parse_struct_fields() that
properly calls parse_static_assert() to consume the assertion and its trailing
semicolon without emitting struct fields.
