Task: Deduplicate ARM and RISC-V F128 soft-float code
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-27

Problem:
ARM f128.rs (337 lines) and RISC-V f128.rs (316 lines) have structurally identical
soft-float library call patterns differing only in register names and instruction syntax.
The emit_f128_cmp() functions in both codegen.rs files also duplicate the same
load-save-load-call orchestration.

Plan:
1. Create a shared F128SoftFloat trait in backend/f128_softfloat.rs with ~10 arch-specific
   primitive methods (load const, load slot, save/restore temp, move arg positions, etc.)
2. Implement shared orchestration functions (operand_to_arg1, store_to_slot,
   store_to_addr, binop, cmp, neg) that call the trait methods
3. Implement the trait for both ARM and RISC-V backends
4. Replace the duplicated code in both f128.rs files and codegen.rs files

Expected outcome:
- ~350 lines of duplicated code eliminated
- Shared module: ~200 lines of orchestration
- Per-backend: ~50-60 lines each of primitive implementations
- Net savings: ~200+ lines
