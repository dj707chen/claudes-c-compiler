Fix IrConst::narrowed_to() for U32 type producing wrong constant value

Bug: narrowed_to() converts I64(4294967295) to U32 as IrConst::I32(-1),
but the convention (used by from_i64) is IrConst::I64(val as u32 as i64).

This causes compound assignments like `unsigned int ui = UINT_MAX; ui /= 5000.0;`
to produce wrong results (1972248982 instead of 858993) because:
1. mem2reg calls narrowed_to() which stores UINT_MAX as I32(-1)
2. constant_fold casts I32(-1) to U64 (getting UINT64_MAX instead of UINT32_MAX)
3. Float division computes wrong result
4. Value is constant-folded to 0x758e2196

Fix: In constants.rs narrowed_to(), U32 case should use I64((*v as u32) as i64)
to match from_i64() convention.
