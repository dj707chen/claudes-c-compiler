Task: Implement wide string literal (L"...") support
Status: COMPLETED

Implemented full wide string literal support:
1. Added WideStringLiteral token kind and AST variant
2. Lexer decodes UTF-8 source chars to Unicode code points for wide strings
3. Parser handles L"a" "b" and L"a" L"b" concatenation
4. IR lowering emits wchar_t (4-byte int) values for local and global arrays
5. Backend emits .long directives for wide string data in .rodata
6. Fixed sizeof for wide strings: (chars + 1) * 4
7. Fixed preprocessor UTF-8 double-encoding in strip_block_comments

Results: 14/17 wide string tests pass (remaining 3 are unrelated vswscanf/%ls issues).
No regressions on broader test suite.
