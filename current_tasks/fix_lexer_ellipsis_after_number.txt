Task: Fix lexer eating ellipsis after integer literal
Status: in_progress

Problem: When the lexer encounters `2...15` (e.g., from `case SLIMBUS_0_RX...SLIMBUS_6_TX:`
after macro expansion), the `.` after `2` is consumed as a decimal point, producing
a float literal `2.` followed by `..` which is not a valid token. This causes parse
errors in the Linux kernel build (sound/soc/qcom/sdm845.c).

Fix: In lex_decimal_number(), before treating `.` as a decimal point, check if the next
two characters are also `.` (forming `...` ellipsis). If so, keep the number as an
integer and let the ellipsis be lexed separately.
