Fix pointer-to-function-pointer dereference call producing SIGSEGV

Bug: Calling through a dereferenced pointer-to-function-pointer
(e.g., `(*fpp)(a, b)` where fpp is `int (**)(int, int)`) segfaults.

Root causes (3 interacting bugs):
1. Parser combine_declarator_parts: all inner Pointers were placed BEFORE
   FunctionPointer, making `int (**fpp)(int,int)` produce the same derived
   list as `int *(*fp)(int)` — [Pointer, Pointer, FunctionPointer]. The extra
   indirection Pointer needs to go AFTER FunctionPointer.
2. is_function_pointer_deref: ptr_sigs fallback was too broad, returning true
   for pointer-to-function-pointer variables (which need a real load).
3. type_builder build_full_ctype: Array declarators after the function pointer
   core were silently skipped (only Pointer/Function were handled in the loop).

Fix:
- Parser: last inner Pointer is syntax marker, extras go after FunctionPointer
- is_function_pointer_deref: only use ptr_sigs when c_type is unavailable
- type_builder: handle Array in the post-core processing loop

Status: IN PROGRESS
