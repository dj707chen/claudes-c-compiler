Task: Fix i686 64-bit atomic operations using cmpxchg8b
Status: in_progress

Problem:
The i686 backend's atomic operations (emit_atomic_rmw, emit_atomic_cmpxchg,
emit_atomic_load, emit_atomic_store) only handle types up to 32 bits.
64-bit types (long long, unsigned long long) on i686 require the cmpxchg8b
instruction which operates on edx:eax (old/expected) and ecx:ebx (new/desired).

Currently, 42 out of 728 atomic-operations tests fail, all involving 64-bit types.

Plan:
1. Add cmpxchg8b-based emit_atomic_cmpxchg for 64-bit types
2. Add cmpxchg8b-based emit_atomic_rmw for 64-bit types (loop around cmpxchg8b)
3. Add atomic load for 64-bit types (using cmpxchg8b with matching expected/desired)
4. Add atomic store for 64-bit types (using cmpxchg8b loop)
5. Fix any remaining issues with __sync_lock_test_and_set/release for 64-bit
