Fix __seg_gs/__seg_fs Named Address Space Support

Implement support for GCC named address spaces (__seg_gs and __seg_fs) to fix
Linux kernel percpu variable access. The kernel uses CONFIG_CC_HAS_NAMED_AS=1
(set when built with GCC >= 12.1), which causes percpu accesses to rely on
__seg_gs type qualifiers instead of explicit %%gs: inline asm prefixes.

Currently __seg_gs/__seg_fs are stripped to empty in the preprocessor, causing
all percpu accesses to lack the %gs: segment override prefix. This means every
percpu variable access reads/writes to the wrong memory location, causing
kernel boot failures.

The fix involves:
1. Adding __seg_gs/__seg_fs as recognized keyword tokens in the lexer
2. Handling them as type qualifiers in the parser (setting address space info)
3. Adding address space tracking to pointer types in the type system
4. Propagating segment info through IR lowering to inline asm and load/store
5. Emitting %gs:/%fs: segment prefixes in x86 backend for qualified accesses
