Task: Fix ARM conditional branch range overflow in large switch statements
Status: in_progress

Problem:
PostgreSQL's gram.c (the grammar parser) contains very large functions with massive switch
statements. On AArch64, b.cond instructions have a +-1MB range limit. When a switch case
target is more than 1MB away from the b.cond instruction, the GNU assembler reports
"conditional branch out of range".

This affects two codegen functions:
1. emit_switch_case_branch: uses bare `b.eq` to branch to case targets
2. emit_switch_jump_table: uses bare `b.hs` to branch to the default label

Fix:
Apply the same invert-and-skip relaxation pattern already used in emit_branch_nonzero
and emit_fused_cmp_branch:
- Invert the condition to branch to a nearby skip label (always in range)
- Use unconditional `b` (+-128MB range) for the actual far target

This is the exact ARM analog of the RISC-V B-type branch range fix already applied.
