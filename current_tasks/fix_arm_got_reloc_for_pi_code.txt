Fix ARM64 GOT relocation generation for position-independent kernel code

The CCC ARM compiler generates GOT-based relocations (R_AARCH64_ADR_GOT_PAGE +
R_AARCH64_LD64_GOT_LO12_NC) for extern symbol references. This causes the kernel
to crash during early boot because:

1. The GOT contains virtual addresses
2. Early boot code (arch/arm64/kernel/pi/) runs before MMU setup
3. Virtual addresses are not valid before MMU is enabled

The fix is to generate direct PC-relative relocations (R_AARCH64_ADR_PREL_PG_HI21 +
R_AARCH64_ADD_ABS_LO12_NC) for extern symbols instead of GOT-indirect addressing.

GCC generates direct PC-relative relocations for all symbols in these files.
The CCC compiler should do the same.

Status: in_progress
