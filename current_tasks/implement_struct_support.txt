Implement struct support: layout calculation, member access, and codegen.

Currently structs are parsed but not lowered or code-generated properly.
MemberAccess and PointerMemberAccess expressions are stubbed with TODO in lowering.rs.

Tasks:
- Add StructLayout computation in common/types.rs (field offsets, alignment, total size)
- Track struct definitions in the lowerer (mapping struct tag -> layout)
- Implement MemberAccess and PointerMemberAccess lowering using GetElementPtr with byte offsets
- Implement struct variable allocation (alloca with correct size)
- Implement struct assignment (memcpy-style)
- All three backends already support GetElementPtr, so codegen should mostly work
- Test with basic struct tests from the test suite
