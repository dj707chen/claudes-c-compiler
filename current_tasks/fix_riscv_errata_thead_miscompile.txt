Task: Fix RISC-V kernel miscompilation of arch/riscv/errata/thead/errata.c
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-27

Problem: Compiling arch/riscv/errata/thead/errata.c with ccc-riscv causes
the kernel to fail to boot (timeout after 395s). Found via delta debugging
with seed 100, total-count 200.

This is a single-file failure - the file alone causes the boot hang when
compiled with our compiler instead of gcc.

Approach: Compare assembly output from ccc-riscv vs riscv64-linux-gnu-gcc,
identify the miscompilation, create a minimal repro, fix the bug.
