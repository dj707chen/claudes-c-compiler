Task: Fix unsigned integer to float constant folding bug
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-27

Bug: constant_fold.rs try_fold_float_cast_mapped did not normalize
sub-64-bit unsigned values before float conversion. An unsigned char
(255) stored as I8(-1) would be sign-extended to i64(-1), then cast
as u64 producing 2^64-1, giving wrong float result.

Also fixing similar issues in lowering/const_eval.rs and sema/const_eval.rs
where target_signed was used instead of source_signed for int-to-float casts.
