Task: Fix miscompilation of arch/x86/kernel/process_64.c causing kernel boot failure

Problem: arch/x86/kernel/process_64.c is miscompiled by ccc, causing kernel boot failure.
This is the x86-64 process management code (thread switching, fork, etc).
Confirmed reproducible 3/3 times.

Status: investigating root cause
