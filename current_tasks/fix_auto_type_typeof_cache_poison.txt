Fix __auto_type + typeof expression type cache poisoning

Bug: When __auto_type resolved its type, the compiler cloned the declaration's
expression trees. After the clone was dropped, heap addresses were reused by
subsequent declarations. The expression type cache (keyed by pointer address)
retained stale entries mapping freed addresses to CType::Int. When a new
pointer-typed expression (e.g., files->fdt) was allocated at the same address,
the cache returned CType::Int instead of CType::Pointer, causing a 32-bit
sign-extending load (movslq) instead of a 64-bit load (movq).

This caused the Linux kernel's fd_install() function (fs/file.c) to be
miscompiled, resulting in boot crashes on x86.

Fix: Clear expr_ctype_cache after creating resolved_decl with cloned
declarators in lower_local_decl, preventing stale cache entries from
poisoning type resolution for subsequent declarations.

Status: completed
