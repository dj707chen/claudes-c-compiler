Unify assembler ELF object writers across all 4 backends.

The 4 backend elf_writer.rs files (x86, i686, ARM, RISC-V) contain ~2500 lines of
duplicated code for ELF object file serialization. The core write_elf/emit_elf pipeline
(header, sections, symtab, strtab, shstrtab, relocations, section headers) is nearly
identical across all backends.

Plan:
1. Create a shared generic ELF object writer in backend/elf.rs that handles the full
   serialization pipeline, parameterized by ELF class (32/64), machine type, flags,
   and REL vs RELA format.
2. Have all 4 backends use this shared writer instead of their own implementations.
3. Also unify: Section/Symbol/Reloc structs, emit_data_values, symbol table building,
   parse_section_flags.
