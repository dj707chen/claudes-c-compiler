Task: Eliminate temporary String allocations from format!() in backend codegen

Profiling shows ~8.6% malloc + ~7% free + ~3.1% Vec::clone = ~19% of compiler time
in allocation. Much of this comes from the 775+ `format!()` calls in backend codegen,
each of which allocates a temporary String, copies it into the output buffer, then drops it.

Solution: Add an `emit!` macro that uses `write!` directly on the AsmOutput buffer via
std::fmt::Write trait, eliminating temporary allocations entirely. Also add `emitln!`
for convenience.

Replace `state.emit(&format!("...", args))` with `emit!(state, "...", args)` across
all backend codegen files.

Status: in progress
