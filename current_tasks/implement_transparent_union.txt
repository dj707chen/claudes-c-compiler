Task: Implement __attribute__((transparent_union)) support

Problem:
The bind() EFAULT issue in redis and postgres is caused by ccc ignoring
__attribute__((transparent_union)). When glibc defines bind() with a
transparent union parameter (under _GNU_SOURCE), ccc treats the union
as a regular struct-by-value argument, causing an extra dereference.

Root cause chain:
1. glibc's sys/socket.h defines __CONST_SOCKADDR_ARG as a transparent_union
2. bind()'s 2nd param is typed as this union
3. ccc classifies it as StructByValReg in param_struct_sizes
4. emit_call does movq (%rax), %rsi instead of movq %rax, %rsi
5. Kernel gets garbage pointer -> EFAULT

Fix plan:
1. Parse transparent_union attribute on union type definitions
2. Store the attribute on CType::Union
3. When building param_struct_sizes, treat transparent_union params as
   their first member type (a pointer), returning None instead of Some(size)
4. When converting arguments at call sites, allow implicit conversion from
   any member type to the transparent union type
5. Add regression test

This is distinct from fix_postgres_bind_efault.txt which describes the
symptom but hasn't identified this root cause.

Status: LOCKED
