Task: Fix pre-store parameter register conflict in ARM/x86/i686 backends
Status: COMPLETED

Bug: When two function parameters have their ParamRef dests assigned to the
same callee-saved register by the register allocator (because their live
ranges don't overlap), the pre-store optimization could overwrite one
parameter's value with another's.

The pre-store optimization moves ABI arg registers to callee-saved registers
in the prologue. But later, emit_param_ref for a non-pre-stored param would
write to the same register, corrupting the pre-stored value.

Fix: Before pre-storing a parameter to a callee-saved register, check if any
other parameter's ParamRef dest is also assigned to that same register. If so,
skip the pre-store to avoid the conflict.

Fixed projects: libharu (ARM segfault), flatcc (ARM segfault), libucl (ARM),
dr_libs (ARM), lz4 (ARM/RISCV now pass).
