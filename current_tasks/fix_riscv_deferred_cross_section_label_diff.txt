Fix RISC-V assembler: deferred expressions with cross-section label differences fail to resolve.

When a .2byte/.4byte directive in one section (e.g., .alternative) references a label difference
like "889f - 888f" where both labels are defined in another section (e.g., .text subsection 1),
the deferred expression resolver fails because it only substitutes labels that are in the same
section as the deferred expression.

The fix: in resolve_deferred_exprs (and resolve_expr_all_labels), also resolve labels from
other sections when the expression involves label differences (both labels in the same foreign
section), since the difference is a compile-time constant.

This fixes kernel build failure: arch/riscv/kernel/entry.S (ALT_ENTRY macro using
"889f - 888f" in .alternative section).
