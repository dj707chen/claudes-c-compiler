Task: Unify CallArgClass and ParamClass into a single ArgClass enum

Status: in_progress

Goal: Eliminate ~400 lines of near-duplicate ABI classification logic between
call_abi.rs (classify_call_args) and call_emit.rs (classify_params_full).

These two functions implement the same ABI classification algorithm with parallel
enum hierarchies (CallArgClass vs ParamClass). Any ABI change must be synchronized
in both places. This refactor will:

1. Create a unified ArgClass enum that supersedes both CallArgClass and ParamClass
2. Create a single core classification function using an ArgInfo trait to abstract
   over both call-site args and callee-side params
3. Keep classify_call_args and classify_params_full as thin wrappers
4. Remove the duplicate classification logic
