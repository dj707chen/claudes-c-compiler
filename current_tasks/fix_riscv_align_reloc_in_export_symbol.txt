Fix RISC-V standalone defconfig kernel build: R_RISCV_ALIGN relocations in .export_symbol

Problem: The standalone RISC-V assembler emits R_RISCV_ALIGN relocations in
the .export_symbol section. When modpost (Linux kernel build tool) processes
these, it interprets the alignment relocation's target (symbol 0 = LOCAL) as
an exported symbol, causing 11113 "local symbol was exported" errors.

Fix: Skip emitting R_RISCV_ALIGN relocations for non-code/non-text sections
like .export_symbol, since alignment relaxation is only meaningful for
instruction sequences, not data sections.
