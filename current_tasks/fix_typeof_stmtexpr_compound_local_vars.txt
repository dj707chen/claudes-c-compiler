Fix typeof() on statement expressions with compound-local variables

When typeof() wraps a statement expression like:
  typeof(({ typeof(a) __x = a; typeof(b) __y = b; __x > __y ? __x : __y; }))

The StmtExpr handler in get_expr_ctype_lowerer tries to resolve the type of the
last expression (__x > __y ? __x : __y), but __x and __y are declared inside the
compound statement and aren't in the lowerer's local variable scope. This causes
the typeof resolution to fail with "could not resolve type of 'typeof' expression".

This is the dominant error preventing x86 defconfig kernel builds (~30+ files fail).
The kernel's min()/max() macros expand to nested __builtin_choose_expr() calls that
produce statement expressions with compound-local variables.

Fix: Extend the StmtExpr handler to build a local scope from the compound's
declarations (reusing resolve_var_type_from_compound logic) and retry expression
type resolution with that scope when the initial resolution fails.

Status: in_progress
