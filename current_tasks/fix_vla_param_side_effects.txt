Fix VLA parameter side effect evaluation.

In C, array parameter declarations like `void foo(int a, int b[a++])` have
the outermost dimension decayed to a pointer, but the size expression (here
`a++`) must still be evaluated for its side effects. Previously, the parser
discarded the outermost dimension expression during array-to-pointer decay.

Fix:
1. Add `vla_size_exprs` field to ParamDecl to preserve dropped expressions
2. In the parser, store the outermost dimension expression before discarding it
3. In IR lowering, evaluate those expressions after parameter allocation

Status: in_progress
