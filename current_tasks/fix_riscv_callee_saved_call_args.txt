Fix RISC-V callee-saved register corruption in emit_call_reg_args

Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-27

Problem:
The RISC-V backend's emit_call_reg_args function uses callee-saved registers
s2-s6 as temporaries when staging GP arguments for function calls with 4+ GP
register args. These registers were NOT added to used_callee_saved, so they
were not saved/restored in the function prologue/epilogue, corrupting the
caller's register state.

This caused a RISC-V kernel boot failure with init/do_mounts_initrd.c: the
kernel_do_mounts_initrd_sysctls_init function calls __register_sysctl_init with
4 GP args, using s2 as a temp without saving it.

Fix:
In calculate_stack_space, scan all call instructions to determine the maximum
number of GP register arguments. When >= 4, add the needed s2-s6 registers to
used_callee_saved so they get proper prologue/epilogue save/restore.
