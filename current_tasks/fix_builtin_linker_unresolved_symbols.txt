Fix builtin linkers (x86, ARM, i686, RISC-V) to properly error on unresolved symbols.

Currently, the builtin linkers silently accept undefined symbols that are not found
in any linked library or object file. This causes configure scripts to incorrectly
detect functions as available (e.g., memset_s in libsodium), leading to compile errors.

The fix should report undefined symbol errors similar to GNU ld, e.g.:
  "undefined reference to `memset_s'"

This affects all 4 architecture linkers.
