Task: Initial C Compiler Scaffold

Building the complete initial scaffold for the C compiler in Rust.
This includes:
- Full directory structure (frontend, ir, passes, backend, common, driver)
- Lexer, preprocessor, parser, sema basics
- x86_64 backend with native ELF generation
- ARM64 and RISC-V backend stubs
- Driver with CLI args
- Three binaries: ccc (x86), ccc-arm, ccc-riscv
- Goal: pass "int main() { return N; }" and simple printf tests
