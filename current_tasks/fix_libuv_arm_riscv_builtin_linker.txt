Fix libuv segfault with builtin linker on ARM and RISC-V

When MY_LD=builtin is set, libuv tests segfault (exit=-11) on ARM and RISC-V.
The builtin assembler works fine. The issue is specifically in the static linker
for these two architectures.

libuv version test passes (just prints the version), but all functional tests
that call libuv APIs (loop, timer, idle, async, tcp_bind, fs) segfault.

This suggests a relocation or symbol resolution issue in the linker.
