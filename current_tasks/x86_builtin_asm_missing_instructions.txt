Add missing x86 instruction encodings to the builtin assembler.

When running with MY_ASM=builtin MY_LD=builtin, many inline assembly tests fail
because the x86 builtin assembler doesn't handle common instructions like:
- clc, stc, cld, std (flag manipulation)
- syscall, cpuid, rdtsc, rdtscp
- pushfq, popfq, pushf, popf (flag push/pop)
- bsrl, bsfl, bsrq, bsfq (bit scan)
- mull, mulw (unsigned multiply)
- bswap without suffix
- int3
- rep movsq, rep stosq, movsq, stosq, movsw, etc. (string ops)
- btsl, btrl, btcl, btl (bit test)
- rcrl, rcll, rcrq, rclq (rotate through carry)
- shldl, shrdl (double-precision shifts for 32-bit)
- negw, negb, notw, notb (16/8-bit unary ops)
- incw, incb, decw, decb
- cmovz/cmovnz/etc without suffix (suffix-less conditional moves)
- cmp/sub/add/mov without suffix (suffix-less ALU ops from inline asm)
- Segment registers (ds, es, fs, gs, cs, ss) in register lookup
- MMX registers (mm0-mm7)
- Various other missing instructions
