Task: Refactor x86 peephole optimizer (2873 lines) into clean submodules

The peephole.rs file is the 4th largest in the codebase (2873 lines).
It has clear logical sections that should be split into submodules, plus
several deduplication and data-table opportunities:

1. Split into logical submodules: line_info, classify, line_store, passes, helpers
2. Replace hand-coded register dispatch trees with const lookup tables
3. Deduplicate NOP-skipping scan pattern (8+ occurrences)
4. Deduplicate byte-range overlap check (3 occurrences)
5. Replace reg_id_to_name 4x16 match blocks with a const 2D array
6. Clean up and document module structure
