Task: Fix typeof on function pointer variables losing type info in CType->TypeSpecifier roundtrip

Bug: When using typeof(global_func_ptr_var) to declare a local variable, the compiler
incorrectly treats the local as an external symbol reference instead of a stack variable.

Root cause: ctype_to_type_spec mapped CType::Function to TypeSpecifier::Int as a fallback.
This meant CType::Pointer(CType::Function(...)) became TypeSpecifier::Pointer(Int),
losing function pointer type info. The local variable's CType was then Pointer(Int)
instead of Pointer(Function(...)), so is_function_pointer() returned false, and calls
through the local were emitted as direct calls to an external symbol.

Fix: Handle CType::Pointer(CType::Function(ft)) specially in ctype_to_type_spec to produce
TypeSpecifier::FunctionPointer(ret, params, variadic), preserving function type info.
Also handle bare CType::Function similarly (function types decay to function pointers).
