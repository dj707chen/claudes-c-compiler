Unify type computation between sema and lowering

Problem: type_spec_to_ctype(), build_full_ctype(), find_function_pointer_core(),
and convert_param_decls_to_ctypes() are duplicated between sema.rs and lowering/types.rs.
This is a correctness timebomb.

Plan:
1. Extract find_function_pointer_core() as a free function (it only examines &[DerivedDeclarator])
2. Extract convert_param_decls_to_ctypes() as a shared function parameterized by a callback
3. Extract type_spec_to_ctype() into a shared module with trait-based callbacks for
   capabilities that differ (expr type inference, const eval)
4. Extract build_full_ctype() into shared module, fixing sema's prefix pointer bug
5. Remove duplicate implementations from sema and lowering
