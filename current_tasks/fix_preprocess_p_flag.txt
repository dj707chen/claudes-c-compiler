Task: Implement -P flag to suppress line markers in preprocessor output
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-27

Problem: The -P flag (suppress line markers in -E output) is completely
unimplemented. This causes the Linux kernel's cc-version.sh to fail because
it parses the preprocessor output with `set --` and the line marker
"# 1 "<stdin>"" gets parsed as the first token instead of "GCC".

The kernel configure step fails with:
  /path/to/ccc-x86: unknown C compiler
  scripts/Kconfig.include:44: Sorry, this C compiler is not supported.

Fix: Add suppress_line_markers flag to Driver, parse -P in main.rs,
and strip line markers from output in run_preprocess_only().
