Fix: user-defined __builtin_alloca should override the compiler builtin

The try_lower_builtin_call function in expr_builtins.rs has a guard that checks
if the user has defined a function with the builtin name. However, this guard
has an exception for Intrinsic builtins (intended for SSE wrappers) that is too
broad - it also catches __builtin_alloca, preventing user-defined overrides.

Fix: narrow the SSE intrinsic exception to only match SSE/SIMD-related names.
