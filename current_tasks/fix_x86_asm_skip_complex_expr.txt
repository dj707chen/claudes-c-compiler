Fix x86 assembler .skip directive with complex label-difference expressions

The kernel ALTERNATIVES macros generate .skip directives with expressions like:
  .skip -(A > 0) * A
  .skip -(A > B) * (A - B)
where A and B are label differences.

Currently the assembler errors with:
  "unsupported .skip expression: -(((.Lx-.Ly)-(.Lz-.Lw)) > 0) * ((.Lx-.Ly)-(.Lz-.Lw))"

This needs the assembler expression evaluator to support:
1. Comparison operators (>, <) on label differences
2. Unary negation on comparison results
3. Multiplication of expressions

All of these should work at link time since label differences within the
same section are known constants after all code is laid out.
