Task: Implement .ifnb/.ifb conditional assembly directives in x86 assembler

Problem:
The x86 assembler does not support .ifnb (if not blank) and .ifb (if blank)
conditional assembly directives. These are GAS directives used in Linux kernel
assembly macros (e.g., IBRS_ENTER in arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S) to conditionally
include code based on whether a macro argument is blank or not.

When the kernel calls IBRS_ENTER without a save_reg argument, the .ifnb block
should be skipped, but instead the assembler processes the instructions inside
the .ifnb block, leading to "mov requires 2 operands, got 1" errors because
`mov %rax, \save_reg` expands to `mov %rax` when save_reg is blank.

Root Cause:
x86 assembler parser.rs expand_gas_macros_with_state() handles .if, .ifc, .ifdef,
.ifndef but NOT .ifnb or .ifb. These directives are simply not recognized.

Fix:
Add .ifnb and .ifb handling in expand_gas_macros_with_state() following the same
pattern as .ifc, and update is_if_start() to recognize them.

Status: IN PROGRESS
