Task: Fix goto cleanup depth clamping panic (mquickjs regression)

Problem: Commit 43fd6c6 ("Fix goto cleanup double-emit") introduced a regression
where collect_scope_cleanup_vars_above_depth(target_depth) panics with a slice
index out of bounds when target_depth > scope_stack.len(). This happens when a
goto jumps forward into a deeper scope than the current one. The prescan records
the label's depth from the AST, but at the goto site the scope stack may be
shallower.

Fix: Clamp target_depth to min(target_depth, scope_stack.len()) in
lower_goto_stmt so the slice index is always valid.

Status: in_progress
