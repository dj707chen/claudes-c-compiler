Task: Fix x86-64 struct return ABI: SSE eightbytes should use xmm registers
Status: completed

Problem:
When returning structs with mixed INTEGER and SSE eightbytes (e.g.,
struct { int a; float b; double c; } which is 16 bytes with 2 eightbytes),
the compiler returns all eightbytes in general-purpose registers (rax, rdx).

Per the SysV AMD64 ABI, eightbytes classified as SSE should be returned in
xmm0/xmm1, not rdx. For example:
- Eightbyte 0: int + float -> INTEGER class -> rax
- Eightbyte 1: double -> SSE class -> xmm0

Fix:
Added ret_eightbyte_classes field to FuncSig, IrFunction, and CallInfo to
propagate SysV eightbyte classification through the compiler pipeline.
Fixed both callee side (emit_return_i128_to_regs) and caller side
(emit_call_store_result) to use xmm registers for SSE-classified eightbytes.
Handles all four combinations: INT+INT, INT+SSE, SSE+INT, SSE+SSE.

Verification:
- All 48 project tests pass across all 4 architectures
- 99.9%+ test pass rate on all architectures
- New regression test: tests/struct-ret-mixed-sse-int-x86/
