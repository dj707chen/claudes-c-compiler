Task: Fix x86-64 struct return ABI: SSE eightbytes should use xmm registers
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-30

Problem:
When returning structs with mixed INTEGER and SSE eightbytes (e.g.,
struct { int a; float b; double c; } which is 16 bytes with 2 eightbytes),
the compiler returns all eightbytes in general-purpose registers (rax, rdx).

Per the SysV AMD64 ABI, eightbytes classified as SSE should be returned in
xmm0/xmm1, not rdx. For example:
- Eightbyte 0: int + float -> INTEGER class -> rax
- Eightbyte 1: double -> SSE class -> xmm0

Currently both eightbytes go into rax:rdx (I128 packing), but the second
eightbyte should go into xmm0.

Fix: Update the two-register struct return path to detect SSE-class eightbytes
and return them in xmm registers instead of general-purpose registers.

Affects: chibicc project test suite (struct_test25 fails), likely other projects
