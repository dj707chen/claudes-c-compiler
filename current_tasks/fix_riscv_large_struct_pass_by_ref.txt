Task: Fix RISC-V large struct pass-by-reference ABI
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-27

Problem: RISC-V LP64 ABI requires aggregates > 16 bytes to be passed by
reference (pointer in GP register), but the compiler was passing them by
copying raw data onto the stack without setting a register to point to it.

This caused kernel boot failure (NULL pointer dereference in rtc_tm_to_ktime)
when drivers/rtc/interface.c was compiled with ccc-riscv.

Root cause: call_abi_config() had large_struct_by_ref: false for RISC-V.
The callee-side emit_store_params had empty match arms for LargeStructByRefReg
and LargeStructByRefStack.

Fix: Set large_struct_by_ref: true and implement callee-side handling to
dereference the pointer and copy struct data into local alloca.
