Fix: switch statement should reject non-integer controlling expression

Bug:
  The compiler silently accepts switch statements with pointer-type controlling
  expressions (e.g., switch(char_ptr)). Per C11 6.8.4.2, the controlling
  expression of a switch statement must have integer type. GCC correctly
  rejects this with "switch quantity not an integer".

Impact:
  This causes PostgreSQL's configure script to incorrectly detect strerror_r
  as returning int (STRERROR_R_INT=1) when compiled with -D_GNU_SOURCE.
  Under _GNU_SOURCE, strerror_r returns char*, and the configure test
  switch(strerror_r(...)) should fail to compile. Because our compiler
  accepts it, postgres uses the wrong strerror_r code path, causing
  error messages to show errno symbols (e.g., "ENOENT") instead of
  human-readable strings (e.g., "No such file or directory").

Fix:
  In the parser or sema, validate that switch controlling expressions have
  integer type. Emit an error (or at minimum a warning) for non-integer types.

  Additionally, the switch codegen should handle the case where a pointer
  value is used (by treating it as an integer comparison) to avoid
  miscompilation even if the validation is only a warning.

Files to change:
  - src/frontend/sema/sema.rs or src/ir/lowering/statements.rs
  - src/frontend/parser/statements.rs

Status: IN PROGRESS
