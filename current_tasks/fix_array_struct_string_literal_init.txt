Fix: array-of-structs initialization with string literal char array fields

Bug: When initializing `struct s arr[2] = {{"ab"}, {"cd"}}` where `struct s { char a[3]; }`,
the compiler stores the ADDRESS of the string literal (as a pointer) instead of COPYING
the string bytes into the char array field.

Root cause: `lower_local_struct_init` in stmt.rs does not check for the case where a
char array field is initialized by a string literal expression. It falls through to
the generic `lower_and_cast_init_expr` path which treats the string literal as a pointer.

Fix: Add string-literal-to-char-array detection in `lower_local_struct_init` and
`lower_struct_field_init_list`, calling `emit_string_to_alloca` instead of storing
the pointer.

This affects all three architectures (x86, ARM, RISC-V) since the bug is in the IR lowering.
