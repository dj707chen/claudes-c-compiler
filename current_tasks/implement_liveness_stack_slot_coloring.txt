Implement liveness-based stack slot coloring for cross-block values

Problem:
  Currently, every cross-block IR value gets its own permanent 8-byte stack slot.
  Values with non-overlapping live intervals could share the same stack slot,
  significantly reducing frame sizes. This is the #1 cause of the postgres
  plpgsql "stack depth exceeded" failure - our frames are ~2x larger than GCC's
  for moderately complex functions, and the effect compounds across recursive calls.

Approach:
  Use the existing liveness analysis (compute_live_intervals) already in
  backend/liveness.rs to perform "stack slot coloring" in calculate_stack_space_common().
  Non-overlapping cross-block values will share stack slots, similar to how the
  register allocator reuses registers when values don't overlap.

  The algorithm is a linear scan over sorted live intervals, maintaining a free
  list of expired slots that can be reused by new values.

Files to change:
  - src/backend/generation.rs (calculate_stack_space_common)

Status: IN PROGRESS
