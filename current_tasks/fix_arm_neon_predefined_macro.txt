Task: Fix Redis ARM build failure by removing __ARM_NEON predefined macro

Problem:
- Redis fails to build on ARM because xxhash.c includes <arm_neon.h>
  and uses NEON vector types (int8x8_t, uint32x4_t, etc.)
- Our compiler defines __ARM_NEON=1 but doesn't actually support NEON intrinsics
  (no arm_neon.h header, no NEON vector type support)
- This causes xxhash.c to fail with thousands of parse errors on ARM

Fix:
- Remove __ARM_NEON define from the ARM preprocessor target setup
- This causes code to fall back to scalar implementations instead of NEON
- Can be re-enabled later when actual NEON support is implemented

Also removing __ARM_FP16_ARGS and __ARM_FP16_FORMAT_IEEE since these relate
to FP16 types we also don't support yet.
