Fix i686 bitfield storage unit alignment
=========================================
Status: in_progress (2026-01-28)

Problem:
On i686, unsigned long long has sizeof=8 but alignment=4.
The bitfield storage unit offset computation in StructLayout::for_struct_with_packing
uses sizeof(type) to compute the storage unit alignment mask:
    field_storage_offset = ((placed_abs_bit / 8) as usize) & !(field_size - 1)

This rounds to 8-byte boundaries, but on i686 long long is only 4-byte aligned.
So a long long bitfield at byte offset 4 gets storage_offset=0 instead of 4,
causing the struct end to be computed as 0+8=8 instead of 4+8=12.

This affects ~25 unit tests in the compiler_suite_0013_* series (struct padding tests
with zero-width bitfields followed by long long bitfields).

Fix:
Change the storage unit alignment mask to use field_align (ABI alignment) instead of
field_size (sizeof). On x86-64 where sizeof == align for long long (both 8), this
makes no difference. On i686 where sizeof=8 but align=4, it correctly uses 4-byte
alignment for the storage unit.
