Fix ARM assembler: numeric local labels (1:, 2:, 3: with 1f, 2b references) are not
being resolved at assembly time. The assembler leaves branch offsets as 0 (branch to self)
and does not emit relocations, causing infinite loops at runtime.

This is the root cause of the ARM standalone kernel boot failure.
The dcache_inval_poc function in arch/arm64/mm/cache.S uses numeric labels
(1:, 2:, 3:) with forward/backward references (1f, 2f, 3f, 2b) that are
not resolved by the assembler.
