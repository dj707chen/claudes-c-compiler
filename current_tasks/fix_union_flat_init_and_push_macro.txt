Task: Fix union flat initialization and implement #pragma push_macro/pop_macro

Issues:
1. Union flat initialization in local variables (stmt.rs emit_struct_init) treats unions
   like structs, consuming one initializer per field instead of just one per union element.
   For example: union { int a; int b; } un[4] = { 10, 20, 30, 40 }
   Currently consumes 2 values per union (treating it like struct), producing [20, 40, 0, 0]
   instead of the correct [10, 20, 30, 40].

2. compute_struct_array_init_count in types.rs uses all union fields for count,
   should use 1 for unions.

3. #pragma push_macro / pop_macro is not implemented in the preprocessor.

Fix locations:
- src/ir/lowering/stmt.rs: emit_struct_init - add is_union break
- src/ir/lowering/types.rs: compute_struct_array_init_count - treat unions as 1 field
- src/frontend/preprocessor/preprocessor.rs: add push_macro/pop_macro support
