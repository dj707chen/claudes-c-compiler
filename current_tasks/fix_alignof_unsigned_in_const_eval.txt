Fix _Alignof and sizeof signedness in parser-level constant evaluator.

_Alignof(type) and sizeof(type) have type size_t (unsigned), but the parser-level
constant evaluator treats them as signed values. This causes expressions like
"0 < -_Alignof(int)" to be false instead of true (unsigned wraparound).

This breaks autoconf C11 detection (valgrind, etc.) which uses:
  _Static_assert(0 < -_Alignof(int), "_Alignof is signed");

Fix: Mark Sizeof, Alignof, GnuAlignof, and AlignofExpr as unsigned in
is_unsigned_int_expr() so comparisons use unsigned semantics.
