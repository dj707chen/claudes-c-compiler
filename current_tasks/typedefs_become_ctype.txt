Lowerer Decomposition Commit 6: Typedefs become HashMap<String, CType>

Change the typedef map in TypeContext from HashMap<String, TypeSpecifier>
to HashMap<String, CType>. This is now safe because CType::Struct("struct.Foo")
is a reference, not a snapshot.

Steps:
- Change typedefs field type in TypeContext
- Update seed_builtin_typedefs to insert CType values
- Update all typedef insertion sites
- Update all typedef lookup sites (resolve_type_spec -> direct CType resolution)
- Delete/simplify TypeSpecifier conversion helpers made dead
- Update function_typedefs / FunctionTypedefInfo to use CType where appropriate
