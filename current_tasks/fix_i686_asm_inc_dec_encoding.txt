Fix i686 assembler inc/dec instruction encoding bug

The i686 encoder's encode_unary_rm() function uses opcode 0xF6/0xF7 for all
unary operations including inc and dec. But 0xF7 /0 is actually 'test r/m32, imm32',
not 'inc'. This causes catastrophic misencoding where subsequent bytes are consumed
as the immediate operand.

Fix: inc and dec need separate handling:
- Register: use compact 0x40+reg (inc) / 0x48+reg (dec) in 32-bit mode
- Memory or byte size: use opcode 0xFE (byte) / 0xFF (word/dword) with modrm
