Fix inline asm memory operand pointer dereference

Inline asm "=m"(*ptr) and "m"(*ptr) constraints were not dereferencing pointers.
Instead of writing to/reading from the memory location pointed to by ptr, the
generated code accessed the stack slot holding the pointer value itself.

This caused PostgreSQL's x86 atomic operations (lock xchgb, lock cmpxchgl,
lock xaddl, lock cmpxchgq) to operate on wrong memory, making postgres --check
hang in a spinlock busy-wait during initdb.
