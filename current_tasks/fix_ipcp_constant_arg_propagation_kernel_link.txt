Task: Fix kernel x86 link failures via IPCP constant argument propagation

Status: in_progress

Problem:
  Linux kernel x86 build fails at link time with undefined references to:
  1. convert_to_fxsr (from signal.o) - function is dead code when
     CONFIG_IA32_EMULATION is disabled, but compiler doesn't eliminate it
  2. __retpoline_sites, __return_sites (from alternative.o) - linker script
     symbols referenced by empty stub functions that should be eliminated

Root cause:
  - IPCP (interprocedural constant propagation) only handled constant return
    values, not constant arguments or dead call elimination
  - Static functions called with known-constant arguments (e.g., always false)
    didn't have that constant propagated into their body
  - Empty void stub functions were still being called, keeping references
    to undefined symbols alive

Fix:
  - Extended IPCP with constant argument propagation for static functions
  - Added dead call elimination for side-effect-free void functions
  - Changed IPCP to run every iteration (not just iter 0) so that constants
    that become available after later optimization passes can be propagated
  - Fixed diminishing-returns early exit to not skip cleanup after IPCP changes
