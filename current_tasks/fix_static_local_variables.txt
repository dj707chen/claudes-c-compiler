Fix static local variables

Static local variables are being treated as regular locals (on stack).
They should be emitted as global variables in .data section with unique names
(e.g., funcname.varname) so they persist across function calls.

Currently: static int x = 10; in a function creates a stack alloca
Expected: static int x = 10; creates a .data section global, referenced by name

Plan:
1. Track 'static' storage class in parser AST declarations
2. In lowering, detect static locals and emit them as IrGlobal with mangled name
3. Reference static locals via GlobalAddr + Load/Store instead of Alloca
4. Ensure initializer is only set once (in .data), not re-initialized each call
