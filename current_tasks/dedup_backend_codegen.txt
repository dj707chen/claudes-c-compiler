Task: Deduplicate backend codegen logic across x86/arm/riscv
Status: IN PROGRESS

Goal: Extract shared cast classification logic, parameter classification helpers,
and float detection patterns from all three backend codegen files into the shared
codegen_shared.rs module. This eliminates ~300+ lines of duplicated code and
fixes the latent bug where all three backends silently emit fadd for unsupported
float ops.

Approach:
1. Add CastKind enum to classify_cast() - shared classification, arch-specific emission
2. Extract shared float detection patterns in emit_binop
3. Clean up completed task files (fix_long_double_variadic_passing is DONE)
