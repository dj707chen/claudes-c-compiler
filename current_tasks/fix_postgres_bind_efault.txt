Task: Fix PostgreSQL postmaster bind() EFAULT

Problem:
After building PostgreSQL with ccc, `make check` gets through temp-install but
the postmaster fails to start with:
  LOG: could not bind IPv6 address "::1": EFAULT
  LOG: could not bind IPv4 address "127.0.0.1": EFAULT
  FATAL: could not create any TCP/IP sockets

The bind() call in StreamServerPort (src/backend/libpq/pqcomm.c:510) passes
addr->ai_addr and addr->ai_addrlen from getaddrinfo results.

Plan:
1. Reproduce the issue by running postgres verify
2. Compile pqcomm.c with gcc while rest uses ccc to confirm the bug is there
3. Bisect to find the miscompiled expression
4. Fix the compiler bug
5. Add regression test

Status: LOCKED
