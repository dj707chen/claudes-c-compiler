Fix exponential expression traversal in sema type inference and const eval

Problem: When compiling expressions with long chains of binary operations
(e.g., 1+1+1+...+1 with 27+ terms), the compiler hangs during sema.

Root cause: Both annotate_expr_type() and annotate_const_value() in sema.rs
call infer_expr_ctype() and eval_const_expr() respectively, which recursively
re-traverse the entire expression subtree without memoization. For a left-
associative chain of N binary operations, infer_expr_ctype makes O(2^N)
recursive calls because infer_binop_ctype calls infer_expr_ctype(lhs) twice
(once for pointer check, once for usual arithmetic conversion).

Fix: Add memoization so that infer_expr_ctype and eval_const_expr consult
the already-computed expr_types and const_values maps before recursing.
This turns O(2^N) into O(N).

Impact: Fixes ~6-25 compilation timeout failures across test suites.

Status: in progress
