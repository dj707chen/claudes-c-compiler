Fix C99 inline function linkage to use internal (static) linkage.

Problem: Plain `inline` functions (without `static`) are emitted with `.globl`
(global) linkage, causing "multiple definition" errors when the same inline
function is included from a header in multiple translation units.

Fix: Treat C99 `inline` definitions as having internal linkage (effectively
`static`), since C99 inline definitions don't provide an external definition.
This also allows unreferenced inline functions to be skipped.

This fixes MicroPython compilation where `MP_COMPRESSED_ROM_TEXT` is declared
as `inline __attribute__((always_inline))` in a header.
