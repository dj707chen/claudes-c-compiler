Comparison Operand Canonicalization for Better Codegen
======================================================

Task: Canonicalize IR Cmp instructions to place constants on the RHS.
Also canonicalize commutative BinOp instructions to place constants on the RHS.
Additionally handle the LHS-constant case in x86 codegen emit_int_cmp_insn_typed.

Motivation: When a Cmp has a constant on the LHS (e.g., `0 < x` or `42 == x`),
the x86 backend loads the constant into a register and does `cmpl %r11d, %eax`
instead of the much more efficient `testl %r11d, %r11d` or `cmpl $42, %r11d`.

This canonicalization at the IR level benefits all backends (x86, arm, riscv).

Status: In progress
