Fix typeof(expr) type computation for binary expressions

Bug: typeof(expr) where expr is a binary arithmetic expression between
non-pointer types (e.g., typeof(1.0 + 2.0), typeof(x + 1.0) where x is int)
returns CType::Int instead of applying the C "usual arithmetic conversions".

Root cause: get_binop_ctype() in expr_types.rs only handles pointer arithmetic
(Add/Sub with pointers) and returns None for all other binary operations. When
get_expr_ctype returns None for a typeof expression, the fallback is CType::Int.

Fix: Add usual arithmetic conversion logic to get_binop_ctype for non-pointer
arithmetic operations (Add, Sub, Mul, Div, Mod) and return the promoted type.
Also handle comparison/logical/bitwise operators which return CType::Int.

This affects all architectures since the bug is in the IR lowering type resolution.
