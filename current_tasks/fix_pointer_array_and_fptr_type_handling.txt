Fix pointer array and function pointer type handling in compute_decl_info

Working on:
1. Array of pointers (int *ptrs[3]) misclassified - wrong alloc_size, is_array=false
2. Function pointer globals called via variable generate direct call instead of indirect
3. String array pattern (const char *strs[]) sizing issues

This is marked as HIGH priority and should fix ~50+ tests.
