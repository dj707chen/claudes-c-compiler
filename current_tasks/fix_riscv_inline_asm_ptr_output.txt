Task: Fix RISC-V inline asm output through pointer dereference + x86-only test skips

Status: in_progress

Description:
1. RISC-V inline asm with "=r"(*out) pattern doesn't store the result back
   through the pointer. The value is computed correctly in a register but never
   written to the memory location pointed to by `out`. Expected output_ptr(50)=55,
   actual=0. This is a RISC-V-specific codegen bug in inline asm output handling.

2. Tests `attribute-naked` and `attribute-optimize-omit-fp` contain x86-specific
   inline assembly but lack architecture skip markers, causing false failures on
   ARM and RISC-V.

Fix:
- Debug and fix the inline asm output-through-pointer codegen on RISC-V
- Add expected.skip.arm and expected.skip.riscv files for x86-only tests
- Also check if ARM has the same output-through-pointer bug
