IN PROGRESS: Refactor spaghetti code in IR lowering module

Target functions for refactoring:
1. try_lower_atomic_builtin (expr.rs, ~446 lines) - Convert from 25+ sequential
   if-name-matches blocks to table-driven dispatch. Unify __atomic_* and __sync_*
   variants. Extract shared helpers for _n vs non-_n, fetch-op vs op-fetch patterns.

2. fill_struct_global_bytes (lowering.rs, ~393 lines) - Extract helper functions:
   - write_string_to_bytes() for 3x duplicated string copy logic
   - Unify struct/union dispatch (only differ by layout constructor)
   - Extract array-of-composite helpers

3. lower_global_init (lowering.rs, ~367 lines) - Break into sub-methods for
   array/struct/scalar global initialization.

Expected impact: ~300+ lines removed, significant clarity improvement.
