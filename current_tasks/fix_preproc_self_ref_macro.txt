Fix preprocessor self-referential macro expansion (blue paint rule)

Bug: When a macro expansion produces a token that was NOT expanded due to
self-reference (e.g., f1(2) -> 2*f1 where f1 is suppressed), the suppressed
token can be re-expanded in subsequent rescans when it appears at the trailing
position and is followed by arguments (e.g., f1(2)(9) -> 2*9*f1 instead of
2*f1(9)).

Per C11 6.10.3.4, tokens that are not expanded due to self-reference must
remain permanently suppressed from further expansion ("blue paint" rule).

Fix: Use a special marker character to tag identifiers that were suppressed
due to self-reference. Skip expansion for any identifier that carries this
marker. Strip markers from final output.

This fixes compiler_suite_0048_0087 (fails on all 3 architectures).
