Fix goto cleanup scope depth panic (regression from 43fd6c6)
=============================================================
Status: in_progress
Date: 2026-01-28

Problem:
Commit 43fd6c6 ("Fix goto cleanup double-emit causing kernel preempt_count corruption")
introduced a regression: when a goto jumps INTO a deeper scope (target_depth > current_depth),
collect_scope_cleanup_vars_above_depth(target_depth) panics with a slice index out of bounds
because scope_stack has fewer entries than target_depth.

Example: A function with goto jumping to a label inside a nested block. The label is at
depth 3 but the goto site only has scope_stack length 2.

This crashes compilation of sqlite3.c and tcc source files.

Fix:
Restore the guard that was present in the previous version of lower_goto_stmt:
When target_depth >= current_depth, no cleanup is needed (we're jumping into a deeper
or same scope). Only clean up when jumping out (current_depth > target_depth).
