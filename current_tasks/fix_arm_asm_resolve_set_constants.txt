Fix ARM assembler resolve_set_constants to process .set directives sequentially

Bug: resolve_set_constants uses a two-pass approach where the first pass collects all
.set definitions into a HashMap (last value wins for duplicate names), then the second
pass substitutes everywhere. For constants that are reassigned multiple times (like
.Lasm_alt_mode in kernel ALTERNATIVE macros), this uses the LAST value everywhere
instead of the value that was current at each point in the source.

Fix: Change to a single sequential pass where the constant map is updated as .set
directives are encountered, and substitution uses the current map state at each line.
