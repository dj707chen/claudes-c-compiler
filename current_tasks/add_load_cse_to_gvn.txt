Task: Add Load CSE (Common Subexpression Elimination) to the GVN pass

Status: in_progress

Goal: Eliminate redundant loads from the same memory address when no
intervening store could have modified the value. Currently GVN handles
BinOp, UnaryOp, Cmp, Cast, and GEP, but not Load instructions.

This means patterns like:
  v1 = Load ptr, i32
  ... (no store to ptr)
  v2 = Load ptr, i32

Will be optimized to:
  v1 = Load ptr, i32
  v2 = Copy v1

This is especially impactful for struct field access patterns in loops
(e.g., s->field accessed multiple times) which are very common in
zlib's hot functions (deflate_slow, longest_match).

Expected performance impact: Significant reduction in redundant memory
loads and stack traffic in generated code.
