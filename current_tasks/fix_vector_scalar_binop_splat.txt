Fix vector-scalar binary operation splat/promotion
===================================================
Status: in_progress

Problem:
Vector element-wise binary operations (v / 2, v + scalar, scalar + v) crash
or produce wrong results because lower_vector_binary_op treats both operands
as vector pointers. When one operand is a scalar (e.g., integer 2), it treats
the scalar value as a memory address and tries to dereference it, causing a
segfault.

Per GCC vector extension semantics, scalar operands in vector binary operations
should be "splatted" (broadcast) to all vector elements.

Additionally:
1. Only the LHS is checked for vector type in lower_binary_op, so scalar + vector
   misses the vector path entirely.
2. The constant-fold fast path doesn't skip vector operations.
3. expr_ctype doesn't return vector type for vector binary operations.

Fix locations:
- src/ir/lowering/expr_ops.rs: check both LHS and RHS for vector type, skip
  constant fold for vectors
- src/ir/lowering/expr_assign.rs: add scalar splat logic to
  lower_vector_binary_op and lower_vector_compound_assign
- src/ir/lowering/complex.rs: expr_ctype should return vector type for
  vector binary operations

Expected impact: Fixes 14+ vector-related tests across all architectures.
