Task: Unify f128_load_sources into shared CodegenState
Status: in_progress

Problem:
ARM and RISC-V backends each maintain their own `f128_load_sources: FxHashMap<u32, (u32, i64, bool)>`
field on their codegen structs, while state.rs has a simpler `FxHashMap<u32, u32>` used only by x86.
This is duplicated code with identical semantics.

Plan:
1. Upgrade state.rs f128_load_sources from FxHashMap<u32, u32> to FxHashMap<u32, (u32, i64, bool)>
2. Update x86 to use the richer type (offset=0, is_indirect=false for backward compat)
3. Remove the duplicate field from ARM and RISC-V codegen structs
4. Update ARM/RISC-V to use state.f128_load_sources instead of self.f128_load_sources
5. Add shared helper methods on CodegenState for common f128_load_sources operations
6. Verify no regressions
