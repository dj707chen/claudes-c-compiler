Fix va_arg with struct types: segfault on all architectures

Problem: va_arg(ap, struct_type) segfaults because the lowering treats struct
va_arg as returning a pointer (IrType::Ptr), but small structs are passed
by value in variadic arguments (their bytes are inline on the va_list, not
behind a pointer).

The fix: In lower_va_arg, detect struct types and emit multiple scalar VaArg
instructions to read the struct data from the va_list, store it to a temporary
alloca, and return the alloca address.

For large structs (>16 bytes on ARM/RISC-V), they are passed by reference,
so the current pointer-based approach is correct for those.

Status: in_progress
