Fix i686 and x86 assembler relocation offset in encode_modrm_mem

Bug: In encode_modrm_mem(), relocations for symbol displacements are recorded
BEFORE the ModR/M and SIB bytes are pushed to self.bytes. Since add_relocation()
uses self.bytes.len() to record the offset, the relocation points to where the
ModR/M byte will be, not where the displacement bytes are.

For REL format (i686), this causes the ELF writer to patch the wrong bytes
when embedding the addend, corrupting ModR/M + SIB encoding.

Fix: Defer relocation recording to after ModR/M + SIB bytes are pushed,
just before the displacement bytes are written.

Impact: All instructions using symbol-displaced memory operands with SIB
(e.g., jmp *.Ljt(,%eax,4) for switch tables) are broken. This causes
100% failure rate for sqlite and likely redis on i686 with MY_ASM=builtin.
