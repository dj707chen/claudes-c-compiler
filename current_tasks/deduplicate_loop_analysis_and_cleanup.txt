Task: Deduplicate loop analysis code and clean up dead debug code

Status: in_progress

Plan:
1. Extract shared loop analysis code (NaturalLoop struct, find_natural_loops,
   compute_loop_body, merge_loops_by_header, find_preheader) from licm.rs and
   iv_strength_reduce.rs into a new shared passes/loop_analysis.rs module.

   These 5 items are copy-pasted verbatim between the two files (~150 lines
   of duplicated code).

2. Remove dead debug formatting functions from inline.rs (dump_function_ir,
   format_operand, format_instruction, format_terminator) that are only called
   behind a debug env var and duplicate IR printing logic.

This is a pure refactoring task - no behavioral changes.
