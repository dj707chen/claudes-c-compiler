Fix x86-64 builtin linker archive group loading.

The x86-64 builtin linker processes archives sequentially in a single pass,
which can miss symbols due to circular dependencies between archives
(e.g., libc.a needs symbols from libgcc.a and vice versa).

The fix implements multi-pass archive group resolution (equivalent to
ld's --start-group/--end-group), iterating all archives until no new
objects are pulled in.

This matches the fix already applied to the RISC-V and ARM linkers.
