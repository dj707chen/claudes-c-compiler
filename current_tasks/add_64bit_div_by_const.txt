Add 64-bit division-by-constant optimization

Currently div_by_const.rs only handles 32-bit divisions (or 64-bit ops
where the operand is provably 32-bit). Genuine 64-bit divisions like
`long long / 10`, `size_t / 100`, etc. still use hardware div/idiv
which costs 20-90 cycles on x86.

This task adds native 64-bit magic number computation using 128-bit
arithmetic (Rust's u128/i128), enabling the same multiply-and-shift
transformation for 64-bit unsigned and signed divisions.

Algorithm: Hacker's Delight adapted for 64-bit:
- Unsigned: compute ceil(2^(64+p) / d) using u128, check error <= 2^p
- Signed: adapted signed magic number with 128-bit intermediate products

This works across all backends since it's an IR-level transformation.
