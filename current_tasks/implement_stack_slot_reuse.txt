Task: Implement stack slot reuse to reduce stack frame bloat

Problem:
The compiler allocates a unique 8-byte stack slot for every SSA value in a function.
This causes stack frames to be 30-40x larger than gcc's output. For recursive functions
like jq's block_bind_subblock_inner, this causes stack overflow (our frame: 2080 bytes,
gcc: 64 bytes).

Solution:
Implement stack slot reuse in calculate_stack_space_common. After computing liveness
(last-use) for each non-alloca SSA value, reuse stack slots from dead values for new
values of the same size. This is conservative and correct since the codegen pattern is:
load operand -> compute -> store result, so a value is only needed until its last use.

Scope:
- Compute last-use for each value across all blocks
- Maintain a free list of 8-byte and 16-byte slots
- When assigning a slot for a new non-alloca value, check free list first
- After all uses of a value, return its slot to the free list
- Alloca values cannot be reused (they hold actual data, not just a value)
