Fix: Range designators with enum constants in 2D array initializers

The expand_range_designators() function in the parser doesn't pass enum
constants to eval_const_int_expr(), so range designators like
[IN_START ... IN_START_INTERP] where IN_START/IN_START_INTERP are enum
constants fail to expand. This causes the affected array rows to be
zero-initialized instead of receiving their designated values.

This is the root cause of the QEMU JSON parse crash at startup - the
json_lexer 2D array uses enum-based range designators.
