Fix RISC-V linker: archive group iteration extracts libc.a members
(stdio.o) that define stderr/stdout/stdin, overriding the shared lib
COPY relocation path. This causes segfaults at runtime because the
linker resolves PCREL_HI20 to the libc.a data section instead of
creating a proper COPY relocation in BSS.

Root cause: During archive group iteration, newly-added undefined symbols
from extracted archive members include stderr/stdout references. On the
next iteration pass, stdio.o from libc.a satisfies these, getting extracted
despite the symbols being available from libc.so. The fix is to exclude
shared-lib-provided symbols from triggering archive member extraction.

This fix affects all architectures that use the same archive resolution
pattern (RISC-V confirmed broken; x86/ARM may have similar latent bugs).
