Task: Fix function pointer struct return type codegen bug
Status: in_progress
Description: param_ctype() peeled ALL pointer layers from function pointer type_spec,
stripping the return type's pointer. For `struct Node *(*fn)(struct Node *)`, the return
type became Struct instead of Pointer(Struct), causing incorrect two-register return
handling. Fix: peel exactly ONE pointer layer (the is_func_ptr indirection).
