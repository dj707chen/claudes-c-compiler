Optimize x86 peephole optimizer performance.

Profiling shows the peephole optimizer takes ~7.8% of total SQLite compile time.
The key bottlenecks are:
1. has_indirect_memory_access is called repeatedly without caching
2. classify_line does speculative store/load parsing on every line (even non-mov)
3. Redundant trim_asm calls throughout all passes
4. register_family does 60-pattern string match

Plan: Cache has_indirect_memory_access result in LineInfo, add fast-path
early exits to classify_line, cache trim offsets, and reduce redundant
string parsing throughout the peephole passes.
