Task: Optimize peephole optimizer compile-time performance

Profiling shows the peephole optimizer consumes ~11% of compiler time on large
files like sqlite3.c (4.4% combined_local_pass, 3.4% peephole_optimize entry,
2.7% eliminate_dead_stores, 0.7% classify_line). Additional ~4.5% in string
operations (memcmp, trim, contains) supporting the peephole.

Plan:
1. Pre-classify self-moves in classify_line (add SelfMove to LineKind)
   - Eliminates string parsing in the hot combined_local_pass loop
2. Pre-parse extension-related info during classify to avoid repeated
   starts_with/ends_with checks in combined_local_pass
3. Merge push/pop elimination into combined_local_pass to reduce number
   of full array scans from 3 to 1 per iteration
4. Short-circuit: if combined_local_pass makes no changes, skip the
   push/pop and binop passes (they can't find new opportunities)
5. Reduce string allocation in peephole patterns
