Fix: Stack Slot Coalescing for Non-Overlapping Allocas

Problem:
The compiler allocates a unique stack slot for every Alloca instruction, even when
allocas have non-overlapping lifetimes (e.g., local variables in different case blocks
of a switch statement). For large bison-generated parsers like PostgreSQL's gram.c
(2000+ case blocks), this causes a 29MB stack frame vs GCC's 3KB, crashing postgres
due to stack overflow.

Root cause:
calculate_stack_space_common() in generation.rs monotonically increments the stack
space for every alloca without considering lifetime overlap.

Fix:
Implement stack slot coalescing in the backend. Compute which allocas have
non-overlapping lifetimes (based on basic block liveness analysis) and assign
them to the same stack memory. This is safe because only one case block executes
at a time, so their local variables never coexist.

Expected impact:
- Fixes PostgreSQL initdb segfault (stack overflow in base_yyparse)
- Reduces stack frame sizes for all functions with large switch statements
- Affects all three architectures (x86, ARM, RISC-V)
