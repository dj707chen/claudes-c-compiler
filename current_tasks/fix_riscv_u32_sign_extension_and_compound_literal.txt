Task: Fix RISC-V U32 sign-extension and compound literal size for designated initializers
Status: completed

Two bugs fixed:

1. Compound literal size calculation: (int[]){[1]=10, [8]=80} used items.len() (4)
   instead of compute_init_list_array_size() (9) for array size, causing stack
   corruption when accessing designated indices beyond items.len().
   Fixed in: src/ir/lowering/expr_access.rs

2. RISC-V ABI compliance: U32->I32 casts were noops, but RISC-V requires all
   32-bit values to be sign-extended in 64-bit registers. Added new
   CastKind::UnsignedToSignedSameSize variant that emits sext.w on RISC-V
   and is a noop on x86/ARM/i686.
   Fixed in: src/backend/cast.rs, src/backend/riscv/codegen/cast_ops.rs,
             src/backend/x86/codegen/f128.rs, src/backend/arm/codegen/cast_ops.rs,
             src/backend/i686/codegen/casts.rs

Both fixes needed for QBE to pass on RISC-V. Also fixed Lua, mquickjs, musl,
and mbedtls on RISC-V. RISC-V test suite improved from 2858/2859 to 2859/2859.

Regression tests added:
  tests/compound-literal-designated-init/
  tests/riscv-u32-sign-extension/
