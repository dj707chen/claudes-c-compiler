Fix: static struct pointer array initializers produce NULL pointers

Bug: When declaring a local static array of struct pointers initialized
with addresses of struct array elements, the initializer values are
emitted as NULL (zero) instead of the correct addresses.

Example that crashes:
  void test(void) {
      static struct S st[3] = {{10}, {20}, {30}};
      static struct S *stp[1] = { &st[0] };
      // stp[0] is NULL instead of &st[0]
  }

The same pattern works correctly for non-struct pointer arrays (int*, char*).
Also works for file-scope arrays and single (non-array) struct pointers.

The fix is in the static initializer emission code, likely in the globals
or const_eval lowering where struct pointer types are handled differently
from scalar pointer types.

Affects all three architectures since this is a frontend/lowering issue.
