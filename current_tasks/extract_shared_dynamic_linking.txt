Extract shared dynamic linking infrastructure to linker_common.rs.

The x86 and ARM linkers have nearly identical load_shared_library() and
resolve_dynamic_symbols() functions (~150 lines each, duplicated x2).
Both also duplicate the linker_defined symbol arrays.

Plan:
1. Add LINKER_DEFINED_SYMBOLS constant to linker_common.rs
2. Add is_linker_defined_symbol() helper
3. Extract match_dynsyms_against_globals() shared logic for matching
   shared library symbols against undefined globals (weak alias detection,
   as-needed tracking)
4. Update x86 linker to call shared functions
5. Update ARM linker to call shared functions

Does NOT overlap with:
- migrate_arm_linker_to_linker_common (which covers load_file/archive/merge/register)
- refactor_riscv_linker (which covers splitting monolithic functions)
