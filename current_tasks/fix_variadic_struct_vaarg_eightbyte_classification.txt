Fix variadic struct va_arg eightbyte classification on x86-64

Bug: When passing structs with mixed int/float fields (e.g., struct {double d; long i;})
to variadic functions, va_arg reads all eightbytes from the GP register save area instead
of using the FP register save area for SSE-classified eightbytes.

Root cause: Two issues in IR lowering:
1. struct_arg_classes was not computed for variadic args beyond fixed params (expr_calls.rs)
2. lower_va_arg_struct read all struct slots as IrType::I64, never using IrType::F64 for
   SSE-classified eightbytes, so the backend always read from gp_offset (expr_access.rs)

Fix:
- expr_calls.rs: Infer eightbyte classification from CType for variadic struct args
- expr_access.rs: Use SysV eightbyte classification to determine per-slot IrType (F64 for
  SSE eightbytes, I64 for Integer eightbytes) in lower_va_arg_struct
