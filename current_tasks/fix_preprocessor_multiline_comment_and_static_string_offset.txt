Fix two bugs:

1. Preprocessor: multi-line comment ending on same line as # directive
   causes directive not to be recognized. E.g.:
   /* comment
   abc*/#/*comment2
   */if 1
   The "#if" should be recognized as a directive but the multi-line comment
   preceding it on the same line prevents this.

2. Static initializer: string literal + constant offset (e.g., "foo" + 1)
   in static pointer array initializer causes SIGSEGV at runtime.
   The compiler needs to emit the correct relocation with an addend.

Tests affected:
- compiler_suite_0125_0000 (preprocessor)
- gcc_torture_pr53084 (string literal + offset in static init)

Files likely modified:
- src/frontend/preprocessor/
- src/ir/lowering/ or src/backend/common.rs (for static init)
