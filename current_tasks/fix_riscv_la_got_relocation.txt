Task: Fix RISC-V GOT relocation boot failure by passing -fno-pic to assembler
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-27

Problem: When compiling kernel .c files with ccc-riscv, the GNU assembler
(riscv64-linux-gnu-gcc) expands `la` pseudo-instructions using R_RISCV_GOT_HI20
(GOT indirection) instead of R_RISCV_PCREL_HI20 (direct PC-relative). This is
because the RISC-V GNU assembler defaults to PIC mode, and our compiler was not
passing -fno-pic to it when PIC is not requested.

The GOT relocations cause kernel boot failures because the kernel linker creates
GOT entries that reference addresses not yet mapped during early boot, leading to
infinite page fault loops.

Fix: In build_asm_extra_args(), pass -fno-pic to the assembler when the compiler
is not in PIC mode (self.pic == false). This ensures `la` expands to PCREL
relocations instead of GOT relocations.
