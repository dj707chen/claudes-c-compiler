Fix x86 long double (F128) unary negation for complex numbers.

The bug: emit_float_neg used xorpd to flip the sign bit of the f64 approximation
in rax, but F128 values are stored as full 80-bit x87 extended precision in their
stack slots. The f64-based sign flip produced wrong results when the full 80-bit
value was subsequently read from the slot.

Fix: Override emit_unaryop in the x86 backend to handle F128 Neg via x87 fchs,
following the same pattern as emit_float_binop for F128 arithmetic.

This fixes 78 failing x86 tests (complex long double negation, imaginary literal ops).
