Deduplicate emit_call across all three backends.

emit_call is the single largest source of code duplication in the compiler (~1343 lines
across x86/ARM/RISC-V). All three backends follow the same multi-phase algorithm:

1. Classify args into register vs stack (struct by value, i128, f128, float, int)
2. Handle stack overflow args (push/store to stack)
3. Load register args (into temp regs, then move to arg regs)
4. Emit call instruction (direct/indirect)
5. Store return value (i128, f128, f32, f64, int dispatch)

The classification is already partly factored into classify_call_args() in codegen_shared.rs
but it's UNUSED and missing struct support. This task will:

- Add StructByValReg/StructByValStack/LargeStructStack variants to CallArgClass
- Make all three backends USE the shared classify_call_args()
- Extract the return-value storage dispatch into a shared default method
- Extract the stack-arg space calculation into a shared helper
