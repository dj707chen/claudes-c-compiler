Fix ARM SVE and NEON builtin type definitions
=============================================
Status: in_progress

Problem:
When compiling for AArch64, system headers (bits/math-vector.h) use GCC builtin
types __Float32x4_t, __Float64x2_t (NEON) and __SVFloat32_t, __SVFloat64_t,
__SVBool_t (SVE). Since we claim __GNUC__=14, the preprocessor conditions
__GNUC_PREREQ(9,0) and __GNUC_PREREQ(10,0) pass, but our compiler doesn't
define these types, causing 70+ parse errors.

This breaks lua, mquickjs, libpng, jq, libjpeg, and tcc on ARM.

Fix:
Define the GCC builtin NEON and SVE types as predefined types for the AArch64
target, either as predefined macros or as recognized type keywords in the parser.
The types only need to parse correctly in function declarations; we don't need
to generate actual SVE/NEON code for them.
