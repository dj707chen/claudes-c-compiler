Task: Fix miscompilation of lib/radix-tree.c causing kernel boot failure
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-26

The kernel file lib/radix-tree.c is miscompiled by ccc, causing the kernel
to fail to boot when this single file is compiled with ccc instead of gcc.
This file implements the radix tree data structure used extensively by the kernel
for page cache lookups and other operations.

Plan:
1. Compare ccc vs gcc assembly output for radix-tree.c
2. Identify which function(s) are miscompiled
3. Create a minimal test case reproducing the bug
4. Fix the compiler bug
5. Verify the fix with --test-one-file
6. Add regression test
