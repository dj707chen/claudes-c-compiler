Fix __attribute__((aligned(N))) for global/static variables

Problem: The compiler doesn't respect __attribute__((aligned(N))) for
global and static variables when emitting section alignment in object files.

Specifically, when a variable is declared with e.g. aligned(64), the .data
section alignment must be at least 64. Currently the section alignment is
hardcoded or set too low (16), so variables requiring higher alignment end
up at misaligned addresses in the final linked binary.

This is the root cause of mquickjs failing at runtime - the JS keyword
atom table (js_stdlib_table) is declared with __attribute__((aligned(64)))
but gets placed at a 16-byte aligned address instead of 64-byte aligned,
causing the JS parser to fail to recognize keywords like "function",
"var", "if", etc.

Plan:
1. Parse __attribute__((aligned(N))) on variable declarations
2. Track alignment requirement per global variable
3. Set section alignment in the object file to max(current_align, var_align)
4. Emit proper alignment padding before aligned variables
5. Add regression tests
6. Verify mquickjs passes
