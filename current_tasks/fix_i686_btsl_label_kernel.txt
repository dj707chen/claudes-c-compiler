Fix i686 assembler: btsl $imm, label (immediate to label/symbol)

The i686 assembler's encode_bt function doesn't handle the case where
the destination is a bare symbol/label (Operand::Label). This breaks
the x86 kernel build in -m16 mode, where trampoline_64.S uses:
    lock btsl $0, pa_tr_lock

The fix: add Operand::Label cases to encode_bt for immediate-to-label
and register-to-label, converting them to absolute memory references
with R_386_32 relocations (same pattern as other i686 instructions).
