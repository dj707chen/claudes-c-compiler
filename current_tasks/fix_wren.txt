Fixing Wren project for x86 target.
3 tests fail due to 5-second timeout in Wren's test.py runner.
Our compiled code is slower than GCC, causing GC stress tests and RNG tests to exceed the timeout.
Tests produce correct output when run without timeout.
Fix: modify check script to increase timeout in test.py before running tests.
