Fix __builtin_bswap64 return type from CType::Int to CType::ULongLong

Problem:
The builtin_return_ctype function in type_checker.rs incorrectly declares
__builtin_bswap64 as returning CType::Int (i.e., int). On i686 this causes
a spurious IntWiden cast (I32 -> I64) to be inserted, which generates a
`cltd` instruction that sign-extends eax to edx:eax, corrupting the high
32 bits of the bswap64 result.

Also, builtin_return_type in expr_types.rs did not list bswap builtins at
all, so the IR type fallback also returned I32.

Fix:
1. type_checker.rs: Changed __builtin_bswap64 to return CType::ULongLong
2. expr_types.rs: Added __builtin_bswap64 => IrType::U64 and
   __builtin_bswap16/__builtin_bswap32 => IrType::I32

Also includes fix for i686 64-bit unary ops (CLZ, CTZ, Popcount, Bswap)
in emit_unaryop which had a `_ => {}` catch-all that silently dropped
these operations for I64/U64 types.

Combined effect: SQLite i686 goes from 195/622 to 622/622 passing.

Status: in_progress
