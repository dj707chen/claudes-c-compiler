Refactor driver/driver.rs into focused submodules (in_progress)

Started: 2026-01-30

The driver/driver.rs file is a 1559-line monolith containing CLI parsing,
external tool invocation, file type detection, GCC fallback logic, and the
compilation pipeline all in one file.

Plan:
- Extract CLI argument parsing into driver/cli.rs (~385 lines)
- Extract external tool invocation (gcc fallback, assembler, linker arg building)
  into driver/external_tools.rs (~180 lines)
- Extract file type detection utilities into driver/file_types.rs (~45 lines)
- Keep the core pipeline (compile_to_assembly, run modes) in driver/driver.rs
- Group Driver struct fields into logical sub-structs where appropriate
- Update driver/README.md
