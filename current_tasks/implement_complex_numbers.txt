Implement _Complex number support

This task adds C99 _Complex type support to fix ~760+ test failures.

Approach:
- Represent _Complex float/double/long double as struct-like types
  with {real, imag} components stored on the stack
- Add ComplexFloat, ComplexDouble, ComplexLongDouble to CType and TypeSpecifier
- Parser already tracks has_complex flag, just need to use it
- Implement arithmetic (+, -, *, /) as component-wise operations
- Add creal/crealf/cimagf/cimag/creall/cimagl as builtins
- Support imaginary literals (1.0i, etc.)
- Handle complex.h header properly

Status: in progress
