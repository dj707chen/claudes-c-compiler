Implement #include_next and fix pp-number suffix macro expansion

1. Implement #include_next preprocessor directive - GCC's wrapper stdint.h
   uses #include_next to forward to the system stdint.h. Searches from the
   next include path after the current file's directory.

2. Fix pp-number suffix detection in macro expander - identifiers after '.'
   were being treated as pp-number suffixes (like 1.0f) even when the dot
   was a struct member access operator. This caused MBEDTLS_PRIVATE(field)
   after '.' to not be expanded, producing undefined symbol references for
   struct members like usage, alg, alg2 in mbedtls.
