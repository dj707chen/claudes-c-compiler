Task: Fix ARM inline asm "i" constraint emitting register name instead of immediate value

Status: in_progress

Problem:
When an inline asm has a pure immediate-only constraint ("i", "n") but the operand is
still an Operand::Value (not a Const) — as happens in standalone bodies of static inline
functions — the ARM backend emits a register name (e.g., "x9") instead of an immediate
value. This causes linker errors like:
  undefined reference to `x9' in .altinstructions section

This breaks kernel compilation of arch/arm64/kvm/hyp/vhe/switch.c because the
alternative_has_cap_unlikely() static inline function's standalone body has
cpucap as a parameter, which can't be resolved to a compile-time constant.

Root cause:
- ARM's classify_constraint("i") returns GpReg (not Immediate)
- The promotion from GpReg to Immediate only happens for Operand::Const values
- For Operand::Value with "i" constraint, the operand stays as GpReg
- The existing fallback (imm_value = Some(0)) only applies to already-Immediate operands

Fix:
Add a check after the const-promotion: if constraint is immediate-only and operand is
still GpReg with a Value operand, promote to Immediate with imm_value=0 placeholder.
