Fix typeof() statement expression extern attribute leakage in parser
=====================================================================
Status: in_progress
Date: 2026-01-30

Problem:
When a typeof() expression contains a statement expression with block-scope
extern declarations, the parser's `self.attrs.extern` flag leaks from the inner
declaration back to the outer declaration context.

Example:
  typeof(({ extern void fn(void); expr; })) ____ptr = ...;
                ^^^^^^^
                This sets self.attrs.extern = true, which leaks back
                to the outer declaration of ____ptr, marking it as extern.

This causes ____ptr to be lowered as a global symbol reference instead of a
stack-local variable, producing undefined linker references.

This is the ROOT CAUSE of the ____ptr/____v global leak issue blocking the
Linux kernel build (not a lowering-phase issue as previously suspected).

Fix:
In parse_typeof_specifier() (types.rs), save and restore self.attrs.flags
before/after parsing the typeof inner expression. This prevents storage-class
specifiers from inner declarations leaking to the outer scope.

Affected files:
- src/frontend/parser/types.rs (parse_typeof_specifier)
- src/frontend/parser/parser.rs (save_flags/restore_flags on ParsedDeclAttrs)
