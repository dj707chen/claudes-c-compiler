Fix x86 assembler: .short/.word numeric label references not resolved

Bug: The numeric label pre-pass in elf/numeric_labels.rs handles AsmItem::Long,
AsmItem::Quad, and AsmItem::Byte but is missing AsmItem::Short. This means
.short/.word/.2byte directives containing numeric label forward/backward references
(like "1f", "3f") keep the raw "1f"/"3f" string instead of being renamed to the
unique .Lnum_N_K form.

Symptom: When the kernel's realmode code uses LJMPW_RM(1f) which expands to
`.word (1f), real_mode_seg`, the "1f" is emitted as a relocation to literal
symbol "1f" instead of being resolved to the numeric label 1: defined later.
This causes:
  ld: undefined reference to `1f'
  ld: undefined reference to `3f'

Fix: Add AsmItem::Short arm to the numeric label resolution match in
resolve_numeric_labels() in src/backend/elf/numeric_labels.rs, identical
to the Long/Quad/Byte handling.
