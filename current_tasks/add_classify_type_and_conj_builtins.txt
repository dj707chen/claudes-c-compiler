Adding __builtin_classify_type and __builtin_conj* builtins

1. Implement __builtin_classify_type(expr) -> int type class
   - Register in sema/builtins.rs as ClassifyType intrinsic
   - Implement lowering in expr_builtins.rs to return GCC-compatible type class

2. Register __builtin_conj, __builtin_conjf, __builtin_conjl in sema/builtins.rs
   - These were missing from the builtin map (only conj/conjf/conjl were registered)
   - Fixes compilation of gcc_torture_20020411_1 and related tests

Fixes 3+ tests across all architectures (gcc_torture_20040709_{1,2}, gcc_torture_20020411_1).
