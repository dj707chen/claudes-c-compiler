Fixing haproxy: linker doesn't auto-generate __start_<section> / __stop_<section> symbols
for custom sections. GNU ld does this when it sees undefined references to those symbols,
placing them at the boundaries of the corresponding section. haproxy relies on this for its
INITCALL mechanism. Without these symbols, init callbacks (filter keywords, etc.) are never
registered, causing NULL pointer dereference in strtok_r.
