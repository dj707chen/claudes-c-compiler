Fix static local variable alignment not inheriting struct type alignment

Problem: lower_local_static_decl() doesn't call alignof_type() to get the natural
alignment from the variable's type specifier (e.g., struct with __attribute__((aligned(16)))).
This causes static locals like `static struct fxregs_state fxregs __initdata` to get
alignment 8 instead of 16, causing fxsave to fault on unaligned address.

This is a kernel boot crash: the fpu__init_system_mxcsr function uses fxsave on a
static struct fxregs_state that requires 16-byte alignment but gets only 8-byte.

Fix: Add the same alignof_type() call that lower_global_decl() already has.
