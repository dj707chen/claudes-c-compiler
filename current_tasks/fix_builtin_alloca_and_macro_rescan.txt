Fix __builtin_alloca intrinsic and variadic macro re-scanning

1. Implement __builtin_alloca as a DynAlloca IR instruction that performs
   dynamic stack allocation (sub rsp/sp, aligned to 16 bytes) instead of
   emitting an undefined "call alloca".

2. Fix variadic macro expansion re-scanning: when a function-like macro
   expansion result is itself a function-like macro name followed by '('
   in the remaining text, continue expanding (loop). This handles patterns
   like: #define BLOCK(...) BLOCK_IDX(__VA_ARGS__, BLOCK_2, BLOCK_1)(__VA_ARGS__)

Both fixes are needed for jq to build (alloca for oniguruma, macro rescan for
the BLOCK dispatch pattern).

Status: In progress
