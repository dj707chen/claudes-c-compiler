Refactor Parser Boolean Flags into ParsedDeclAttrs Struct

Status: in_progress

The Parser struct has 17 boolean fields and 8 Option<T> fields that are all
"parsing_*" flags set during parse_type_specifier/parse_attributes and consumed
afterward. These create implicit coupling and fragile control flow.

Plan:
- Create a ParsedDeclAttrs struct that groups all these flags
- Replace the individual fields on Parser with a single `parsed_attrs: ParsedDeclAttrs` field
- Update all set/consume/reset sites to use the new struct
- The struct will have a Default impl that initializes everything to false/None
- Add a reset() method to clear all fields at once
