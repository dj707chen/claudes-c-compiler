Fix Wren project build script: test runner timeout too short

The Wren project's check_x86.sh runs `python3 ./util/test.py` which has a
hardcoded 5-second per-test timeout. Three tests (deeply_nested_gc,
many_reallocations, sample_count_multiple) take 5-30 seconds even when
compiled with GCC, causing them to timeout and fail.

Fix: Patch util/test.py to increase timeout from 5 to 60 seconds before
running the test suite.

This is a build script issue, not a compiler bug.
Status: in_progress
