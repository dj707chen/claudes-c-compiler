Task: Convert ARM assembler directives from string-bag to typed enum
Status: in_progress

Problem: The ARM parser uses untyped AsmStatement::Directive { name: String, args: String }
for all directives, forcing the ELF writer to re-parse strings. This duplicates parsing
logic, provides no compile-time safety, and mixes concerns.

Fix: Create a typed AsmDirective enum (like x86's AsmItem) where each directive variant
carries already-parsed, structured data. Update the parser to produce typed directives
and the ELF writer to pattern-match on them without string re-parsing.

Scope: ARM only (RISC-V deferred for later).
