Migrate RISC-V linker to use linker_common shared ELF64 infrastructure.

The RISC-V linker (riscv/linker/elf_read.rs + link.rs) duplicates the ELF64
object parsing that already exists in linker_common.rs. The x86 and ARM backends
both use linker_common::parse_elf64_object() and its types (Elf64Object,
Elf64Symbol, Elf64Rela, etc.), but RISC-V has its own ObjFile/ObjSymbol/ObjReloc
types and its own parse_obj() function.

This task migrates the RISC-V linker to use the shared linker_common types and
parser, eliminating the duplicated code and making all three ELF64 backends
consistent. The shared library symbol parsing will also be migrated.
