Fix yyjson i686 build failure caused by incorrect peephole optimization.

The i686 peephole pass was converting `addl $1, %reg` → `incl %reg` even when
the next instruction was `adcl $0, %reg` (which reads the carry flag). Since
`incl` does not set the carry flag (unlike `addl`), this broke 64-bit negation
(notl+notl+addl+adcl pattern) and likely other multi-word arithmetic.

Fix: guard the inc/dec peephole conversions to skip when the next instruction
reads the carry flag (adcl, sbbl, etc.).
