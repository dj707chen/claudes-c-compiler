Task: Implement enum constant resolution in lowerer

The parser and sema already handle enum declarations, but the lowerer
doesn't have access to enum constants. This causes enum constant identifiers
to be treated as undefined global symbols, resulting in link errors.

Fix: Add enum constant collection in the lowerer so that enum constants
are resolved to their integer values during expression lowering.

Changes needed:
- Add enum_constants map to Lowerer struct
- Collect enum constants from AST during initial lowering pass
- Resolve enum constant identifiers in eval_const_expr
- Resolve enum constant identifiers in lower_expr (Identifier case)
