Task: Unify LocalInfo/GlobalInfo with shared VarInfo, eliminate dual-lookup pattern

The IR lowering module has two structs (LocalInfo, GlobalInfo) sharing 8 of their
fields. This causes a duplicated "if locals.get(name) ... if globals.get(name)"
lookup pattern repeated 10+ times across lowering.rs, types.rs, and expr.rs.

Changes:
1. Extract shared VarInfo struct containing: ty, elem_size, is_array, pointee_type,
   struct_layout, is_struct, array_dim_strides, c_type
2. Make LocalInfo and GlobalInfo contain VarInfo plus their unique fields
3. Add Lowerer::lookup_var_info(name) -> Option<&VarInfo> that checks locals then globals
4. Replace 10+ dual-lookup sites with the unified lookup helper
5. Unify field_is_array/field_is_struct/field_is_complex into get_field_ctype
6. Unify resolve_member_field_ctype / resolve_pointer_member_field_ctype with
   a single resolve_field_ctype(expr, field, is_pointer_access) method

Status: In progress
