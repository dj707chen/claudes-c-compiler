Refactor the global initialization spaghetti code in ir/lowering/.

Problem:
- global_init_compound.rs (1706 lines), global_init_bytes.rs (1267 lines), and
  global_init.rs (1019 lines) total ~3992 lines with massive code duplication
- The same GlobalInit::byte_size() match is copy-pasted 5 times in compound.rs
- The same "emit compound or bytes for sub-struct" block is copy-pasted 5 times (~25 lines each)
- lower_struct_global_init_compound() is 502 lines of deeply nested spaghetti (6+ levels)
- StructLayout::default() is written out manually 5 times
- The bytes and compound files reimplement the same struct/array init logic in different output formats

Fix:
- Add GlobalInit::byte_size() method to eliminate duplicated match blocks
- Add StructLayout::empty() or Default impl to eliminate boilerplate
- Extract helper functions for repeated compound/bytes emission patterns
- Split the 502-line lower_struct_global_init_compound into union vs struct paths
- Extract common designator resolution logic into shared helpers
- General cleanup of deeply nested code paths

Files affected: ir/lowering/global_init.rs, ir/lowering/global_init_bytes.rs,
ir/lowering/global_init_compound.rs (and possibly ir/ir.rs for GlobalInit methods)
