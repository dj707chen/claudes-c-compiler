Fix: static variables declared via function typedefs not emitted as globals

Bug: When a static global variable is declared using a function typedef, e.g.:
  typedef int (fn_type)(int, int);
  static fn_type *callback;

The compiler incorrectly treats `callback` as a function declaration instead
of a pointer-to-function variable. This causes it to be emitted as an undefined
external symbol (U) rather than a local BSS symbol (b), leading to linker errors
("Unexpected GOT/PLT entries detected") when linking the kernel.

Found via delta debugging on ARM with drivers/firmware/psci/psci.c.

Fix locations:
1. src/ir/lowering/global_decl.rs: add declarator.derived.is_empty() check
2. src/ir/lowering/lowering.rs: restrict typedef-as-function registration to empty derived
