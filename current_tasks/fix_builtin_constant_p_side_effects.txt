Fix __builtin_constant_p evaluating its argument (side effects)

__builtin_constant_p should NOT evaluate its argument per GCC semantics.
The argument is only checked for constness at compile time.

This bug caused Chibi-Scheme's tolower() macro expansion (__tobody) to
double-evaluate function calls, since __builtin_constant_p(read_char(...))
was executing the read_char() call before returning 0.

Fix: remove self.lower_expr(arg) call in the non-inline-candidate path
of lower_constant_p().

Status: in_progress
