Fix -include flag to search include paths

The -include flag was only resolving files relative to CWD.
When -include is given a system header name (e.g., -include ctype.h),
it should search the include paths (-I, -isystem, system defaults)
like #include "file" would, not just look in CWD.

This fix enables tdb to compile (it uses -include ctype.h).
Status: in_progress
