Task: Fix x86 kernel miscompilation in mm/page_alloc.c

The delta debugging tool identified that mm/page_alloc.c compiled with our
compiler causes an x86 boot failure (timeout - kernel hangs during boot).
The page allocator is the kernel's most critical memory subsystem.

Investigating the root cause by comparing gcc vs our compiler assembly output
and narrowing down the specific function(s) being miscompiled.

Status: in_progress
