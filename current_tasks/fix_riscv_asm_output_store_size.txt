Fix RISC-V inline asm output operand store size bug.

Bug: When inline asm has an "=r" output constraint for a 32-bit type
(uint32_t), the compiler stores the result back using `sd` (8-byte store)
instead of `sw` (4-byte store). This corrupts adjacent stack memory.

Example: `asm("lw %0, %1" : "=r"(rb[i]) : "m"(buf[i]));`
The lw loads 32 bits into a register (sign-extended to 64-bit on RV64).
The compiler then writes the result back with `sd`, overwriting 8 bytes
instead of 4, corrupting the next 4 bytes of adjacent stack variables.

This affects any inline asm with register output constraints for sub-64-bit
types on RISC-V. Could affect kernel code using inline asm with 32-bit outputs.

Root cause: The RISC-V codegen emits store instructions based on the register
width (64-bit) rather than the C type width (32-bit) of the output operand.
