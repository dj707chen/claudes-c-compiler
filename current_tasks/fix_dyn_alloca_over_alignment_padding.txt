Fix dyn_alloca (VLA) over-alignment padding bug
================================================
Status: in_progress
Date: 2026-01-26

Problem:
  emit_dyn_alloca in backend/traits.rs does not allocate enough space when
  alignment exceeds 16 bytes. It subtracts round_up_16(size) from SP, then
  aligns the pointer upward by up to (align-1) bytes. The aligned pointer
  can exceed the allocated region, corrupting the stack.

  Static Alloca correctly adds (align-1) extra bytes (generation.rs line 928).
  DynAlloca does not.

  This causes intermittent stack corruption for VLAs with _Alignas(32+).

Fix:
  When align > 16, round up size to align (instead of just 16) before
  subtracting from SP. Since align is always a power of 2 >= 32, rounding
  up to align guarantees both:
  - Enough padding (at least align-1 extra bytes)
  - SP remains 16-byte aligned (align is a multiple of 16)

  Then emit_align_acc aligns the pointer within the correctly-sized region.

Files to modify:
  - src/backend/traits.rs (emit_dyn_alloca)
  - Add new trait method or modify round-up logic
  - Add regression test
