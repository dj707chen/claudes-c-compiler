Fix designated initializer backward index jump in nested array initializers

Bug: When a 2D array uses designated initializers with backward jumps
(e.g., [5]=10, [2]=20), the nested brace-enclosed sub-initializer fails
to reset the current index for backward jumps. It continues sequentially
instead of jumping back.

Reproducer:
    static const unsigned char tbl[][10] = {
        { [5] = 10, [2] = 20, [8] = 30 },
    };
    // Expected: tbl[0][2]=20, tbl[0][5]=10, tbl[0][8]=30
    // Got:      tbl[0][5]=10, tbl[0][6]=20, tbl[0][8]=30

Impact: Breaks musl's vfprintf state machine table (states[][58]) which
uses character-based designated initializers that jump backward frequently.
This causes printf("%s") to not produce output, failing 5/6 musl tests.
Also likely affects other code using complex designated initializer patterns.

Fix: In the global initializer serialization code (global_init_bytes.rs
and/or global_init_compound.rs), find where designated array indices are
processed for nested braces and ensure backward jumps are handled.
