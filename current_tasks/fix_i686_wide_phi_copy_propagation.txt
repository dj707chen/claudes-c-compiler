Fix i686 wide value propagation through phi Copy chains
========================================================
Status: in_progress
Date: 2026-01-28

Problem:
On i686, 64-bit values (F64, I64, U64) require 8-byte copies (two movl
instructions). The "wide value" tracking system marks initial producers
(Load, BinOp, etc.) as wide during stack layout, then propagates wide
status through Copy instructions at codegen time.

However, this runtime propagation depends on block processing order.
Phi elimination creates Copy instructions in predecessor blocks, and
when a loop's merge block (.L5) is processed BEFORE the latch block
(.L7), the Copy at the merge block doesn't know its source is wide
because the latch block hasn't been processed yet.

This causes phi copies of F64 values to use the 4-byte default path,
corrupting the upper 32 bits.

Fix:
Pre-compute wide status for ALL values by propagating through Copy
chains during stack layout, before codegen begins. Use a fixpoint
iteration to handle cycles.

Affected tests:
- compiler_suite_0152_0157: double array accumulation (wrong values)
- compiler_suite_0152_0159: similar double accumulation
- compiler_suite_0152_0163: similar double accumulation
- compiler_suite_0135_*: various double computation tests
- compiler_suite_0166_*: double loop accumulation
- And potentially more tests with double/i64 phi nodes in loops
