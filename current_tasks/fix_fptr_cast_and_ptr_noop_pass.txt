Task: Fix function pointer cast parsing and Ptr<->U64 no-op cast pass-through

Fixes:
1. Parser: function pointer casts like (int (*)(int, int))fn_ptr were not handled
   in parse_cast_expr. Added detection of function pointer pattern after pointer stars
   and proper type wrapping.
2. IR lowering: Ptr<->U64 casts were not treated as no-ops, only Ptr<->I64 was.
   Extended the pass-through condition to include U64.

Status: In Progress
