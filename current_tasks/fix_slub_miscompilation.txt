Task: Fix mm/slub.c miscompilation causing kernel boot failure
Status: in_progress

The kernel SLUB memory allocator (mm/slub.c) is miscompiled by ccc,
causing the kernel to fail to boot when this single file is compiled
with ccc instead of gcc. Need to investigate the generated assembly
to find the miscompilation root cause.
