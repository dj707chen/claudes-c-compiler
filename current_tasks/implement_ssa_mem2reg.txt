Task: Implement SSA mem2reg pass
Status: IN PROGRESS

Description:
Implementing the mem2reg (memory to register) promotion pass that converts
alloca-based IR to SSA form with phi nodes. This includes:

1. Adding Phi instruction variant to the IR
2. Building dominator tree (Cooper-Harvey-Kennedy algorithm)
3. Computing dominance frontiers
4. Identifying promotable allocas (scalar, only loaded/stored, not address-taken)
5. Phi insertion via iterated dominance frontier
6. SSA variable renaming
7. Updating backend codegen and optimization passes for Phi support
