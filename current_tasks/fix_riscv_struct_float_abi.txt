Task: Fix RISC-V LP64D struct float/double field ABI calling convention
Status: in_progress
Description: On RISC-V LP64D, structs containing float/double members should be
passed in FP registers per the psABI "hardware floating-point calling convention":
- struct with 1 float/double only → 1 FP register
- struct with 2 float/double members (HFA) → 2 FP registers
- struct with 1 float/double + 1 integer ≤ XLEN → FP reg + GP reg
Currently all structs are passed in GP registers, causing ABI incompatibility
with GCC-compiled code and failing tests compiler_suite_0147_0047 and 0147_0051.
