Fix preprocessor pp-number suffix false positive for dot-member access

Bug: Function-like macros are not expanded when they appear after a
double-dot member access chain where the intermediate member name ends
in a digit, e.g., `a.member2.MACRO(x)` fails to expand MACRO.

Root cause: In macro_defs.rs expand_text(), line 219 checks if the
character before a dot is a digit to decide if the current identifier
is a pp-number suffix. But it doesn't walk backwards to verify the
entire token starts with a digit. An identifier like `member2` ends
with `2`, causing a false positive.

Fix: Use is_ppnumber_context() (which walks backwards) instead of
a simple single-character digit check.

Status: in_progress
