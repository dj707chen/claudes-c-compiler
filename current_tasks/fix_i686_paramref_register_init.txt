Fix i686 ParamRef register initialization bug causing SQLite segfault

When a ParamRef dest has both a register assignment and shares the alloca's
stack slot, emit_param_ref_impl returns early (same-slot optimization) without
initializing the callee-saved register. This causes garbage values to be used
when the value is later read from the register.

The fix: when dest has a register assignment, load from the alloca slot and
store to the register even when dest_slot == alloca_slot.
