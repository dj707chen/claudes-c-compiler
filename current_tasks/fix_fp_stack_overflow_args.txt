Fix floating-point stack overflow argument passing

Bug: When calling a function with more than 8 floating-point arguments,
the overflow arguments (9th and beyond) are not correctly passed on the stack.
On x86-64, args go in xmm0-xmm7, then stack. On ARM64, args go in d0-d7, then stack.
On RISC-V, args go in fa0-fa7, then stack.

Currently the 9th+ float/double args are lost (garbage values received by callee).

Example:
  double sum9(double a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i) { return a+b+c+d+e+f+g+h+i; }
  sum9(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) => returns 36 instead of 45 (9th arg lost)

This affects all three backends and causes ~28 "many-parameters" test failures.

Root cause: The shared ABI classification code (call_abi.rs / call_emit.rs)
does not properly handle floating-point arguments that overflow registers
and must be placed on the stack.

Status: IN PROGRESS
