Task: fix_asm_immediate_string_literal
Status: in_progress
Description: Fix extract_symbol_name to handle Expr::StringLiteral for inline asm 'i' constraint operands. 
Currently, string literal immediates (e.g., "i" (__FILE__)) cause has_unsatisfiable_imm to be true,
which skips the entire asm body including .pushsection data. This causes NULL pointer crashes in the
kernel PM trace subsystem (drivers/base/power/main.c).
