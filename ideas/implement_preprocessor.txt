Implement a real C preprocessor:
- #define with macro expansion (object-like and function-like macros)
- #include with file resolution (system headers from /usr/include)
- #if, #ifdef, #ifndef, #elif, #else, #endif with expression evaluation
- Predefined macros (__LINE__, __FILE__, __DATE__, __TIME__, etc.)
- Token pasting (##) and stringification (#)

This is critical for passing tests that use #include <stdio.h> properly
rather than relying on gcc's assembler/linker to resolve symbols.
Many test failures are due to missing preprocessor support.
