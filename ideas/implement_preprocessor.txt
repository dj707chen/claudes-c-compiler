Remaining preprocessor work:
- #include with actual file resolution (system headers from /usr/include)
  Currently we strip #include and provide built-in macros for common headers,
  but we don't actually read and include header files.
  This is critical for passing tests that use #include <stdio.h> properly
  rather than relying on gcc's assembler/linker to resolve symbols.
- Complete variadic macro support (named variadic params, ##__VA_ARGS__ GNU extension)
- #line directive support for source mapping
- _Pragma operator
