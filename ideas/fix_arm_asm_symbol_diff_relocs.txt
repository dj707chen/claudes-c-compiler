Fix ARM assembler: symbol difference relocations in .word/.long directives

The ARM (AArch64) assembler has the same bug that was fixed in the RISC-V
assembler: `.word A - B` expressions emit a single absolute R_AARCH64_ABS32
relocation instead of R_AARCH64_ADD/SUB pairs.

This affects jump tables and will cause linker errors when linking with
MY_ASM=builtin for ARM targets.

See the RISC-V fix in commit "RISC-V assembler: fix symbol difference
relocations and .bss section type" for the approach:
- Add Add32/Sub32/Add64/Sub64 to RelocType
- Add try_emit_symbol_diff() method to ElfWriter
- Also fix .bss default section type to @nobits

The .bss section type issue likely also exists in the ARM assembler.
