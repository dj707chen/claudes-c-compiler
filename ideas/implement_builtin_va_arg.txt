Implement __builtin_va_arg parser and codegen support.

Problem: __builtin_va_arg(ap, type) is a special construct where the second
argument is a type, not an expression. Our parser currently doesn't handle
this, causing the type name to be treated as an undeclared identifier.

This blocks: Lua (lobject.c uses __builtin_va_arg with typedef types like
l_uacInt and l_uacNumber).

Fix needed:
1. Parser: Recognize __builtin_va_arg as a special expression, parse the
   second argument as a type-name (not expression).
2. IR: Add a VaArg IR instruction that takes a va_list pointer and a type.
3. Codegen: Implement the System V AMD64 va_arg ABI:
   - For GP types: load from reg_save_area or overflow_arg_area
   - For FP types: load from reg_save_area (FP area) or overflow_arg_area
   - Update gp_offset/fp_offset/overflow_arg_area accordingly

Also need: __builtin_va_start, __builtin_va_end, __builtin_va_copy with
proper ABI support. Currently these might be mapped to libc functions
but the actual va_list struct layout needs to match the ABI.
