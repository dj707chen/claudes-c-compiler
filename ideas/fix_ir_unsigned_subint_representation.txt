Fix IrConst Unsigned Sub-Int Type Representation
=================================================
Date: 2026-01-26
Priority: MOSTLY FIXED (2026-02-05)

STATUS UPDATE (2026-02-05)
--------------------------
Fixed narrowed_to() in constants.rs to use I64 with zero-extension for all
unsigned types (U8, U16, U32), matching the from_i64() convention. This was
causing compound assignments like `unsigned int ui = UINT_MAX; ui /= 5000.0;`
to produce wrong results because mem2reg's narrowed_to() stored UINT_MAX as
I32(-1), and constant folding then interpreted -1 as UINT64_MAX.

REMAINING ISSUE
---------------
from_i64() correctly stores U8/U16/U32 as I64 with zero-extension.
narrowed_to() now also correctly stores unsigned types as I64 with zero-extension.

The main remaining concern is places where optimization passes create IrConst
values directly (not through from_i64 or narrowed_to) for unsigned types.
These should be audited to ensure they follow the I64 zero-extension convention.
