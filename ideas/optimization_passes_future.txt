Future optimization passes to implement:

The following passes are implemented and working:
- Constant folding (constant_fold.rs)
- Dead code elimination (dce.rs)
- Local value numbering / CSE (gvn.rs)
- Algebraic simplification (simplify.rs)

Next passes to add:
1. LICM (Loop Invariant Code Motion): Move loop-invariant computations out
   of loops. Requires loop detection (natural loops via dominators + back edges).

2. Function inlining: For small functions, inline the callee body at call sites.
   Start with leaf functions < N instructions.

3. Dominator-based GVN: Extend current local GVN to cross basic block boundaries
   using a dominator tree. This enables more CSE opportunities.

4. Copy propagation: When %x = copy %y, replace all uses of %x with %y.
   This pairs well with constant folding + DCE to further clean up IR.

5. Constant propagation (SCCP): Sparse conditional constant propagation -
   propagate constants through the CFG, taking branch conditions into account.

6. Strength reduction in loops: Replace expensive operations (mul) with
   cheaper ones (add) for loop induction variables.

Priority: MEDIUM (existing passes handle the most impactful cases)
