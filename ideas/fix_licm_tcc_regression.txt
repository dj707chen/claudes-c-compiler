Fix LICM optimization regression that breaks TCC

The LICM (Loop-Invariant Code Motion) commit 7bd1987 introduced a regression
that causes TCC binaries compiled by ccc to hang (infinite loop). This was
bisected: commit 76e3ca9 (pre-LICM) produces working TCC binaries, while
7bd1987 produces hanging ones.

The TCC binary hangs even on simple operations like `tcc -v`, suggesting
the LICM pass is incorrectly hoisting or transforming code in one of TCC's
source files (likely tccgen.c or tccpp.c which are the most complex).

To investigate:
1. Build TCC .o files one at a time with LICM enabled vs disabled
2. Identify which .o file causes the hang (binary search)
3. Narrow down to the specific function being miscompiled
4. Check LICM's loop analysis and invariant detection logic

This blocks TCC from being verified via the verify_tcc.py script.
The long double fix (separate task) is also needed for TCC's test 70.
