Reduce Stack Frame Size for PostgreSQL
=======================================

PostgreSQL's plpgsql "recursion_test(4,3)" fails with "stack depth limit
exceeded" at max_stack_depth=2048kB. Our stack frames are ~3.8x larger
than GCC's.

Root causes:
1. Every SSA temporary gets an 8-byte stack slot, even for i32/i16/i8 types.
2. Intermediate SSA values from expression evaluation each get their own slot.

Remaining fixes:
1. Use 4-byte slots for i32 and smaller types (HIGH IMPACT but UNSAFE as-is)
   - Attempted: movl store/load for I32 values causes sign-extension bugs.
     When an I32 value (e.g. -1 = 0xFFFFFFFF) is stored with movl and loaded
     back with movl, it zero-extends to 0x00000000FFFFFFFF instead of
     sign-extending to 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF. This breaks code like
     `sign * (zic_t) hh` where a 32-bit int is implicitly widened to 64 bits.
   - The codegen's accumulator-based model doesn't distinguish between
     "32-bit value that will only be used in 32-bit ops" vs "32-bit value
     that will be sign/zero-extended to 64 bits". Until the IR tracks this
     distinction, 4-byte store/load is not safe.
   - Alternative approach: reduce slot usage through better register
     allocation and elimination of redundant spills.

2. Skip slot allocation for single-use values consumed immediately (HIGH IMPACT)
   - If a value is defined at instruction N and only used at N+1, it doesn't
     need a stack slot (stays in accumulator register)
   - Could eliminate 30-50% of slots

Note: Caller-saved register allocation is now done on all four backends.
