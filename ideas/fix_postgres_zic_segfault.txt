RESOLVED: Fix PostgreSQL zic (timezone compiler) segfault

Two bugs were found and fixed:

1. va_list parameter passing: lower_va_arg (and va_start/va_end/va_copy builtins)
   used lower_address_of on va_list expressions, which is wrong when va_list is a
   function parameter (pointer type after array-to-pointer decay). Fixed by adding
   lower_va_list_pointer helper that checks is_array to distinguish local vs parameter.

2. 2D global array init: flatten_global_array_init had <= instead of < in the padding
   loop, inserting a spurious zero before each element in inner dimensions.

3. Stack overflow on large files: Increased compiler thread stack to 64MB.

After these fixes, zic runs correctly and processes all timezone data. The temp-install
step in make check now succeeds.

REMAINING: The postmaster itself has a bind() EFAULT issue when starting up.
This is a separate bug (likely struct/ABI issue in socket handling code) that
needs a new investigation.
