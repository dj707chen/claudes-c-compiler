Fix Remaining ARM (AArch64) Test Failures
==========================================
Updated: 2026-01-30
Total: ~11 failing out of ~28600 (99.6% pass rate)

RECENT FIXES
============
- Fixed inline asm literal brace preservation (NEON ld1/st1 syntax)
- Fixed FP/SIMD register naming (v-prefix for unmodified operands)
- Fixed FP/SIMD clobber alias normalization (v/d/s/q aliasing)
- ARM pass rate improved from ~98% to 99.6%

REMAINING FAILURES (~11 tests)
==============================

1. NEON 128-bit vector load/store via "w" constraint (~5 tests):
   - eor, tbl, uzp1, ins/umov produce wrong results for upper 64 bits
   - Root cause: IrType maps vectors to Ptr (8 bytes), so FP load/store
     uses fmov d (64-bit) instead of ldr/str q (128-bit)
   - Fix: need vector type awareness in IrType, or detect vector_size(16)
     at lowering time and pass 128-bit size info to backend

2. ARM processor feature flags (~1 test):
   - asm-pmull-arm-006: "selected processor does not support pmull"
   - Fix: pass -march=armv8-a+crypto to assembler for crypto instructions

3. Register variable incorrect values (~1 test):
   - asm-reg-variable-arm-001c: register variable reads show garbage
   - Fix: investigate register variable initialization/reading path

4. Non-asm failures (~4 tests):
   - c_testsuite_00204: SIGSEGV on complex varargs test
   - compiler_suite_0119_0208: wrong result
   - compiler_suite_0147_0046/0051/0052: complex number operation wrong

PRIORITY
========
1. Fix NEON 128-bit vector load/store (biggest impact, 5+ tests)
2. Fix complex number operations (shared across architectures)
3. Pass -march=armv8-a+crypto for crypto asm tests
