Fix PostgreSQL postmaster bind() EFAULT

After fixing zic segfault and 2D array init, postgres make check gets past
temp-install but the postmaster fails to start with:

  LOG: could not bind IPv6 address "::1": EFAULT
  LOG: could not bind IPv4 address "127.0.0.1": EFAULT
  FATAL: could not create any TCP/IP sockets

The bind() call in StreamServerPort (src/backend/libpq/pqcomm.c:510) passes
addr->ai_addr and addr->ai_addrlen from getaddrinfo results.

Simple test programs using the same getaddrinfo + bind pattern work correctly
with our compiler. The issue is specific to how postgres compiles this code
path, possibly related to:
- Complex control flow in StreamServerPort affecting register/stack state
- ereport() error reporting macro (uses varargs) corrupting state
- Struct member access through multiple levels of pointer indirection
- setsockopt() with (char *)&one cast somehow corrupting the addr pointer

To investigate:
1. Compile pqcomm.c with gcc, rest with ccc, to confirm it's in pqcomm.c
2. Add debug printf before the bind call to inspect addr values
3. Bisect the function to find the miscompiled expression
