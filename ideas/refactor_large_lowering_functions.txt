LOW PRIORITY: One remaining lowering function refactoring

All significant refactoring items are complete. The only remaining opportunity:

- lower_function (lowering.rs, ~340 lines): could be split into lower_function_params,
  lower_function_body, emit_implicit_return. But the function already has clear phase
  comments and reasonable structure, so this is cosmetic.
