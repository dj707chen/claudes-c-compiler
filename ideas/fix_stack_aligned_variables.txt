Fix stack alignment for variables with _Alignas / __attribute__((aligned(N)))

Struct member alignment is now fixed (per-field _Alignas and aligned attribute
flow through to struct layout computation). But local variables with alignment
attributes are NOT yet aligned on the stack.

Examples that fail:
  _Alignas(16) int x;           // stack variable not 16-byte aligned
  int y __attribute__((aligned(32)));  // same issue

This requires codegen changes:
1. Track alignment requirements on alloca/stack slots in the IR
2. In each backend's stack frame layout, ensure aligned variables get
   appropriate padding so their stack offsets satisfy alignment requirements
3. May need to dynamically align the stack pointer for very large alignments
   (e.g., aligned(256)) using AND masking on the frame pointer

Failing tests: compiler_suite_0103_* (local variable alignment checks),
gcc_torture_stkalign (uses alloca with alignment)
