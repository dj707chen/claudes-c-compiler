Replace gcc-based assembler/linker with native ELF generation:

1. Write an x86-64 instruction encoder that directly emits machine code
2. Write an ELF object file writer
3. Write a simple linker that:
   - Resolves relocations
   - Links with system libc (read its ELF to find symbols)
   - Generates a complete ELF executable

This removes the dependency on gcc for assembly and linking.
Start with x86-64, then extend to ARM and RISC-V.
