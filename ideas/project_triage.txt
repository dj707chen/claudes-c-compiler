Project Verification Triage
============================

Status of all 16 verification targets as of 2026-01-25.
Failures are based on running verify_*.py scripts.

PASSING (14):
  - zlib:          PASS (all backends)
  - lua:           PASS (all backends)
  - libsodium:     PASS (all backends — fixed GEP fold i128 bug)
  - mquickjs:      PASS (all backends)
  - libpng:        PASS (all backends)
  - libjpeg-turbo: PASS (all backends)
  - sqlite:        PASS (all backends, 622/622 sqllogictest)
  - libuv:         PASS (all backends)
  - redis:         PASS (all backends)
  - libffi:        PASS (all backends)
  - musl:          PASS (all backends)
  - tcc:           PASS (all backends)
  - jq:            PASS (all backends — fixed exponential const eval hang)
  - mbedtls:       PASS (all 7 tests — fixed peephole bswap store forwarding bug)

FAILING:
  liburing:
    Status: FAIL (all backends)
    Notes: Builds but all 5 runtime tests fail. io_uring_queue_init
           returns -1 (EPERM). This is likely a Docker/kernel limitation
           rather than a compiler bug.
    Action: Low priority. Verify by running the test with GCC-compiled
            binary — if it also fails, this is an environment issue.

  postgres:
    Status: FAIL (all backends)
    Notes: Builds successfully. initdb fails at runtime.
    Action: Debug initdb crash. Compare with GCC-compiled initdb.

PRIORITY ORDER for fixing:
  1. Fix postgres initdb (complex)
  2. Verify liburing is an environment issue
