Project Verification Triage
============================

Status of all 16 verification targets as of 2026-01-25.
Failures are based on running verify_*.py scripts.

PASSING (12):
  - zlib:          PASS (all backends)
  - lua:           PASS (all backends)
  - libsodium:     PASS (all backends — fixed GEP fold i128 bug)
  - mquickjs:      PASS (all backends)
  - libpng:        PASS (all backends)
  - libjpeg-turbo: PASS (all backends)
  - sqlite:        PASS (all backends, 622/622 sqllogictest)
  - libuv:         PASS (all backends)
  - redis:         PASS (all backends)
  - libffi:        PASS (all backends)
  - musl:          PASS (all backends)
  - tcc:           PASS (all backends)

PARTIAL:
  mbedtls:
    Status: PARTIAL (4/7 tests pass; ECP and RSA tests fail)
    Notes: md5, sha256, sha512, aes pass. rsa, ecp fail (exit=1).
           Self-test reports 5 test suite failures: ECP SW test
           and ECJPAKE handshake. Likely a codegen bug in big-integer
           or modular arithmetic used by RSA/ECP.
    Action: Debug RSA test first (simpler). Compare assembly for
            mbedtls_mpi_mul_mpi against GCC output.

FAILING:
  jq:
    Status: FAIL / TIMEOUT (all backends)
    Notes: Build times out after 60 seconds. Likely a compile-time
           hang in a large function (e.g., jv_print or parse).
    Action: Identify which file/function causes the hang. May be
            LICM or another optimization pass running in O(n^2).

  liburing:
    Status: FAIL (all backends)
    Notes: Builds but all 5 runtime tests fail. io_uring_queue_init
           returns -1 (EPERM). This is likely a Docker/kernel limitation
           rather than a compiler bug.
    Action: Low priority. Verify by running the test with GCC-compiled
            binary — if it also fails, this is an environment issue.

  postgres:
    Status: FAIL (all backends)
    Notes: Builds successfully. initdb fails at runtime.
    Action: Debug initdb crash. Compare with GCC-compiled initdb.

PRIORITY ORDER for fixing:
  1. Fix mbedtls ECP/RSA (close to passing, already partially works)
  2. Fix jq compile-time hang (likely optimization issue)
  3. Fix postgres initdb (complex, low priority)
  4. Verify liburing is an environment issue
