Refactor: decompose emit_struct_init (532 lines, 9-deep nesting)

The function `emit_struct_init` in src/ir/lowering/stmt.rs (lines ~1332-1864)
is the single largest function in the codebase at 532 lines with up to 9 levels
of nesting. It handles ALL of:

- Field designator resolution
- Anonymous struct/union member drilling
- Nested designators (.a.j)
- Array field init with index designators (.field[idx])
- Multi-dimensional array init (.a[1][2])
- Flat init consumption across array boundaries
- Array-of-structs init
- Array-of-complex init
- String literal special cases for char arrays
- Complex field init
- Scalar/bitfield init
- Union single-field semantics

The function uses a manual while loop with item_idx and scattered
continue/item_idx++ that makes control flow hard to follow.

Proposed decomposition (5-6 sub-functions):
1. emit_struct_field_scalar_init - single scalar/bitfield field init
2. emit_struct_field_array_init - array field initialization
3. emit_struct_field_complex_init - complex number field init
4. emit_struct_field_substruct_init - nested struct/union init
5. emit_designated_array_element_init - designator-based array element
6. emit_flat_array_continuation - flat init that crosses array boundaries

This is high-risk because the function has many subtle edge cases that
are tested by the test suite (struct-array, designated-init tags).
Should be done incrementally, extracting one sub-function at a time
with test verification after each extraction.
