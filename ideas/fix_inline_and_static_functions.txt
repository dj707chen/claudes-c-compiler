Remaining issues with static/inline functions:

1. Our compiler sometimes generates BSS globals for local variables declared
   inside blocks within switch cases and macro expansions. For example,
   'int cond;' inside a { } block might be emitted as a global BSS symbol.
   This is likely a parser/codegen scope issue with variable declarations
   inside nested blocks.

2. KERNEL CRITICAL: Our compiler emits standalone definitions for `static inline`
   functions instead of inlining them. This causes objtool validation failures
   in the Linux kernel. For example, the kernel's `stac()` inline function
   (which does a STAC instruction) is emitted as a standalone function. objtool
   then flags it with "return with UACCESS enabled" because a standalone stac()
   function returns without a matching clac(). GCC never emits these functions
   at all - it always inlines them. This is the #1 blocker for kernel boot
   after the Spectre mitigation flags have been fixed.

   Impact: Every kernel .c file includes headers with these inline functions,
   so ALL compiled files fail objtool validation.

   Fix: Implement basic inlining for `static inline` functions, or at minimum
   don't emit standalone definitions for functions that have only been called
   (never had their address taken).
