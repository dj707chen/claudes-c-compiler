Fix PostgreSQL bootstrap script segfault

After fixing the inline asm typed operands (spinlock hang), PostgreSQL initdb
now progresses further but segfaults during "running bootstrap script":

  creating configuration files ... ok
  running bootstrap script ... Segmentation fault (core dumped)
  child process exited with exit code 139

The bootstrap script phase runs the postgres backend in single-user/bootstrap
mode. This is a different code path from the spinlock issue (which is now fixed).

Debugging approach:
1. Build postgres with CCC --build-only, install to a temp prefix
2. Run initdb under gdb (or use gdb on the postgres subprocess)
3. Try mixed compilation: compile most files with GCC, swap in CCC one at a time
   to isolate which source file is miscompiled
4. Focus on the bootstrap code path in src/backend/bootstrap/
5. Check struct layout mismatches between CCC and GCC-compiled objects
