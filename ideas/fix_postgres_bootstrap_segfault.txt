Fix PostgreSQL bootstrap script crash - invalid memory alloc request

After fixing the typedef pointer array global init bug (which resolved the
"unrecognized lock method: 1" error), PostgreSQL initdb now fails with a
different error during "running bootstrap script":

  running bootstrap script ... FATAL: invalid memory alloc request size 70806467520
  PANIC: cannot abort transaction 1, it was already committed

The 70GB allocation request (70806467520 = ~66 * 1024^3) suggests a corrupted
size value being passed to palloc/MemoryContextAlloc. This is likely another
compiler bug where a value is being computed incorrectly.

Debugging approach:
1. Build postgres with CCC, install to a temp prefix
2. Run postgres --boot under gdb, break on MemoryContextAlloc
3. Check where the oversized value comes from (likely a truncated or
   sign-extended computation)
4. Try mixed compilation: compile most files with GCC, swap in CCC one at a time
   to isolate which source file is miscompiled
5. Focus on the bootstrap code path in src/backend/bootstrap/
6. Check for integer type promotion bugs or struct field access issues
