Struct/union feature improvements needed:

1. Struct copy/assignment (s1 = s2): Need to emit memcpy-style code
   for struct-to-struct assignment. Currently only field-by-field access works.

2. Struct passing to functions: DONE for all three backends (x86, ARM, RISC-V).
   Small structs (<=16 bytes) passed by value in GP registers.
   Large structs (>16 bytes) passed on the stack (MEMORY class).

3. Struct return values: Functions returning structs need the hidden first
   parameter (sret) ABI handling.

4. Designated initializers: Most cases now work including:
   - .a[1]=1, 7 (continuation after nested designator into array field)
   - .t.a[1] = {1,2,3} (nested struct + array index + brace-list value)
   - Compound literal with designators: (struct s){ {.a[1]=2,8} }
   - Compound literals now use full emit_struct_init path
   Still needs work: very deep nesting edge cases.

5. Nested struct initialization: Basic cases work. Multi-dimensional arrays of
   char * pointers (e.g., char *c[2][1][1][1][3]) need more work.

6. Anonymous structs/unions as members.

7. Bitfield access (partially working but needs proper mask/shift).

8. Array members in structs (e.g., struct { int arr[10]; }).
   Need proper layout and GEP for arr[i] within the struct.

9. Struct layout scoping: FIXED. Local struct definitions are properly scoped;
   a local struct with the same tag name as a global struct shadows the global
   layout within its scope, and the global layout is restored when the scope exits.
